Various neuroimaging studies, both structural and functional, have provided support for the proposal that a distributed brain network is likely to be the neural basis of intelligence. The theory of Distributed Intelligent Processing Systems (DIPS), first developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence, was proposed to adequately model distributed neural intelligent processing. In addition, the neural efficiency hypothesis suggests that individuals with higher intelligence display more focused cortical activation during cognitive performance, resulting in lower total brain activation when compared with individuals who have lower intelligence. This may be understood as a property of the DIPS.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
In our study, a new EEG brain mapping technique, based on the neural efficiency hypothesis and the notion of the brain as a Distributed Intelligence Processing System, was used to investigate the correlations between IQ evaluated with WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) and WISC (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children), and the brain activity associated with visual and verbal processing, in order to test the validity of a distributed neural basis for intelligence.

CONCLUSION
The present results support these claims and the neural efficiency hypothesis.},

  abstract = {This short survey the reviews recent literature on brain connectivity studies. It encompasses all forms of static and dynamic connectivity whether anatomical, functional, or effective. The last decade has seen an ever increasing number of studies devoted to deduce functional or effective connectivity, mostly from functional neuroimaging experiments. Resting state conditions have become a dominant experimental paradigm, and a number of resting state networks, among them the prominent default mode network, have been identified. Graphical models represent a convenient vehicle to formalize experimental findings and to closely and quantitatively characterize the various networks identified. Underlying these abstract concepts are anatomical networks, the so-called connectome, which can be investigated by functional imaging techniques as well. Future studies have to bridge the gap between anatomical neuronal connections and related functional or effective connectivities.},

Conclusions from previous resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of functional connectivity (FC), and only recently studies have begun to capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior, though limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain. Here, we review recent findings, methodological considerations, neural and behavioral correlates, and future directions in the emerging field of dynamic FC investigations.},

In this article we review the advantages of the resting state signal for clinical applications including detailed discussion of signal to noise considerations.

  abstract = {Functional imaging studies have shown that certain brain regions, including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), consistently show greater activity during resting states than during cognitive tasks. This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated by task demands and what functions it might subserve.},

Strong empirical links exist between fluid intelligence and processing speed on the one hand, and white matter integrity and processing speed on the other. We propose a watershed model that integrates these three explanatory levels in a principled manner in a single statistical model, with processing speed and white matter figuring as intermediate endophenotypes. We fit this model in a large (N=555) adult lifespan cohort from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) using multiple measures of processing speed, white matter health and fluid intelligence. The model fit the data well, outperforming competing models and providing evidence for a many-to-one mapping between white matter integrity, processing speed and fluid intelligence. The model can be naturally extended to integrate other cognitive domains, endophenotypes and genotypes.},

  abstract = {Background: It is beneficial to evaluate changes in neuroscience research field regarding research directions and topics over a defined period. Such information enables stakeholders to quickly identify the most influential research and incorporate latest evidence into research-informed education. To our knowledge, no study reported changes in neuroscience literature over the last decade. Therefore, the current study determined research terms with highest citation scores, compared publication shares of research areas and contributing countries in this field from 2006\textendash{}2015 and identified the most productive journals. Methods: Data were extracted from Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Only articles and reviews published in journals classified under the JCR ``Neurosciences'' category over the period of interest were included. Title and abstract fields of each included publication were extracted and analyzed via VOSviewer to identify recurring terms with high relative citation scores. Two term maps were produced for publications over the study period to illustrate the extent of co-occurrence, and the impact of terms was evaluated based on their relative citation scores. To further describe the recent research priority or ``hot spots,'' ten terms with the highest relative citation scores were identified annually. In addition, by applying Bradford's law, we identified ten journals being the most productive journals per annum over the survey period and evaluated their bilbiometric performances. Results: From 2006\textendash{}2015, there were 47 terms involved in the annual lists of top ten terms with highest relative citation scores. The most frequently recurring terms were autism (8), meta-analysis (7), functional connectivity (6), default mode network (4) and neuroimaging (4). Neuroscience research related to psychology and behavioral sciences showed an increase in publication share over the survey period, and China has become one of the major contributors to neuroscience research. Ten journals were frequently identified ($\geq$8 years) as core journals within the survey period. Discussion: The landscape of neuroscience research has changed recently, and this paper provides contemporary overview for researchers and health care workers interested in this field's research and developments. Brain imaging and brain connectivity terms had high relative citation scores.},

  abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution ($<$100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony.},

  abstract = {The neuronal causes of individual differences in mental abilities such as intelligence are complex and profoundly important. Understanding these abilities has the potential to facilitate their enhancement. The purpose of this study was to identify the functional brain network characteristics and their relation to psychometric intelligence. In particular, we examined whether the functional network exhibits efficient small-world network attributes (high clustering and short path length) and whether these small-world network parameters are associated with intellectual performance. High-density resting state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in 74 healthy subjects to analyze graph-theoretical functional network characteristics at an intracortical level. Ravens advanced progressive matrices were used to assess intelligence. We found that the clustering coefficient and path length of the functional network are strongly related to intelligence. Thus, the more intelligent the subjects are the more the functional brain network resembles a small-world network. We further identified the parietal cortex as a main hub of this resting state network as indicated by increased degree centrality that is associated with higher intelligence. Taken together, this is the first study that substantiates the neural efficiency hypothesis as well as the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT) of intelligence in the context of functional brain network characteristics. These theories are currently the most established intelligence theories in neuroscience.

Interestingly, recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.},

Because these propositions had been widely criticized in public media as being false and pseudoscientific, they are examined here for support in the scientific literature. All are found to be reasonably well supported. Most experts agree that there is a general factor g on which human beings differ. It is measured to some degree by most tests of cognitive aptitude and achievement, but more accurately by tests designed to measure it. It corresponds to most people\&\#39;s concept of intelligence. It is quite stable over the life span, and properly constructed and administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against different social groups. It is substantially influenced by genetic factors, but also by environmental factors. Some psychometric findings about g have been poorly presented to the public or widely misunderstood. The public is urged to recognize that (1) psycho-metrics (literally, mental measurement) is a rigorous scientific discipline that has resolved many questions concerning cognitive abilities; (2) general ability scores should be taken not as direct measures of hereditary intelligence, but rather as measures of rate of progress over the life span in achieving full mental development; (3) there are many other cognitive abilities besides g; (4) important sources of variation in g or IQ are environmental; (5) the IQ is possibly more an indicator of how fast the individual can learn that it is of the individual\&\#39;s capability of learning; and (6) much more research is needed to resolve questions about the role of individual differences in cognitive abilities in a democratic society.

Here we synthesize past observations to provide strong evidence that the default network is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. Analysis of connectional anatomy in the monkey supports the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight into function, the default network is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. Probing the functional anatomy of the network in detail reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems. The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex. The implications of these functional and anatomical observations are discussed in relation to possible adaptive roles of the default network for using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world.

  abstract = {Graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional connectivity MRI data (ie. diffusion tractography or cortical volume correlation and resting-state or task-related (effective) fMRI, respectively) has provided new measures of human brain organization in vivo. The most striking discovery is that the whole-brain network exhibits \&quot;small-world\&quot; properties shared with many other complex systems (social, technological, information, biological). This topology allows a high efficiency at different spatial and temporal scale with a very low wiring and energy cost. Its modular organization also allows for a high level of adaptation. In addition, degree distribution of brain networks demonstrates highly connected hubs that are crucial for the whole-network functioning. Many of these hubs have been identified in regions previously defined as belonging to the default-mode network (potentially explaining the high basal metabolism of this network) and the attentional networks. This could explain the crucial role of these hub regions in physiology (task-related fMRI data) as well as in pathophysiology. Indeed, such topological definition provides a reliable framework for predicting behavioral consequences of focal or multifocal lesions such as stroke, tumors or multiple sclerosis. It also brings new insights into a better understanding of pathophysiology of many neurological or psychiatric diseases affecting specific local or global brain networks such as epilepsy, Alzheimer\&\#39;s disease or schizophrenia. Graph theoretical analysis of connectivity MRI data provides an outstanding framework to merge anatomical and functional data in order to better understand brain pathologies.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

The value of network studies of the brain is underscored by the range of network alterations that have been identified in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and many others. Here we briefly summarize the concepts of graph theory that are used to quantify network properties and describe common experimental approaches for analysis of brain networks of structural and functional connectivity. These range from tract tracing to functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. We then summarize the major findings from the application of graph theory to nervous systems ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to more complex primate brains, including man. Focusing, then, on studies involving the amygdala, a brain region that has attracted intense interest as a center for emotional processing, fear, and motivation, we discuss the features of the amygdala in brain networks for fear conditioning and emotional perception. Finally, to highlight the utility of graph theory for studying dysfunction of the amygdala in mental illness, we review data with regard to changes in the hub properties of the amygdala in brain networks of patients with depression. We suggest that network studies of the human brain may serve to focus attention on regions and connections that act as principal drivers and controllers of brain function in health and disease.\textdagger{}Published 2016},

We addressed the extent to which this prediction was true using three mental ability batteries administered to a heterogeneous sample of 436 adults. Though the particular tasks used in the batteries reflected varying conceptions of the range of human intellectual performance, the g factors identified by the batteries were completely correlated (correlations were .99, .99, and 1.00).

The report by Thompson et al. 1 in this issue represents an important step forward because it bridges these two fields. The authors used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create three-dimensional maps of gray matter and then computed correlations between these measures and general cognitive ability (\&\#39;g\&\#39;), derived from diverse cognitive tests for 40 individuals. What makes this study special is that the subjects were twins\textemdash{}10 pairs of monozygotic (MZ or identical) twins and 10 pairs of dizygotic (DZ or fraternal) twins\textemdash{}allowing the authors to estimate the genetic contribution to individual differences in gray matter volume in various brain regions. The new study 1 focuses on the influence of naturally occurring genetic variation on normal interindividual variation, that is, the standard deviation found for nearly any characteristic assessed sensitively enough. Heredity is not only about passing species-general characteristics from parent to offspring, but also about transmitting variation in such characteristics (Fig. 1). Indeed, inheritance of variation is the mainspring of evolution, and thus a central focus of genetics. In contrast , most neuroscience research focuses on universal characteristics. Although perspectives are not right or wrong, just more or less useful for particular purposes, the species-universals perspective and the individual-differences perspective can arrive at different answers because they ask different questions. One exciting finding from the Thomp-son et al. study 1 is the high heritability for gray matter volume in several cortical regions. The remarkably high correlations (about 0.95) for MZ twins mean that MZ co-twins are virtually identical in their volume of gray matter. The same measures for DZ twins, who like any brother and sister are only 50\% similar genetically , are much less correlated. Although previous twin studies reported high heritability for brain region volumes assessed by MRI (reviewed in ref. 4), the present study 1 goes beyond mere size to the more specific measure of gray matter volume, thus ruling out differences in white matter volume. Gray matter consists of neural cell bodies, whereas white matter consists of axons. Connections among neurons reflect, at least in part, the results of learning\textemdash{}which might be expected to differ among individuals as a result of experience.

However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.},

Despite its wide application, the task has been employed with extraordinary variability in administration and scoring and in the composition of stimulus item sets. We have generated a set of test items containing quasi-randomly derived block-tapping sequences. In another study, we investigated item difficulty as a function of path configuration and showed a decline in performance with increasing span capacity load. In the current cross-sectional study, we evaluated developmental differences in span capacity by measuring performances of school children from grade 1 (M age = 7 years) to grade 8 (M age = 14) and a young adult sample (M age = 21 years). Mean span capacity increased incrementally and linearly with age, and no gender difference was observed. The increase in performance with advancing age supports the notion that spatial immediate memory capacity increases with maturation throughout childhood. Comparisons indicated that the span capacity of eighth graders (M = 6.9) was not statistically different from that of the young adults (M = 7.1), suggesting an upper developmental plateau for spatial span in early adolescence. This study provides a normative database for this widely utilized measure of spatial memory.},

  abstract = {Accurate motor performance may depend on the scaling of distinct oscillatory activity within the motor cortex and effective neural communication between the motor cortex and other brain areas. Oscillatory activity within the beta-band (13-30Hz) has been suggested to provide distinct functional roles for attention and sensorimotor control, yet it remains unclear how beta-band and other oscillatory activity within and between cortical regions is coordinated to enhance motor performance. We explore this open issue by simultaneously measuring high-density cortical activity and elbow flexor and extensor neuromuscular activity during ballistic movements, and manipulating error using high and low visual gain across three target distances. Compared with low visual gain, high visual gain decreased movement errors at each distance. Group analyses in 3D source-space revealed increased theta-, alpha-, and beta-band desynchronization of the contralateral motor cortex and medial parietal cortex in high visual gain conditions and this corresponded to reduced movement error. Dynamic causal modeling was used to compute connectivity between motor cortex and parietal cortex. Analyses revealed that gain affected the directionally-specific connectivity across broadband frequencies from parietal to sensorimotor cortex but not from sensorimotor cortex to parietal cortex. These new findings provide support for the interpretation that broad-band oscillations in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands within sensorimotor and parietal cortex coordinate to facilitate accurate upper limb movement.
SUMMARY STATEMENT: Our findings establish a link between sensorimotor oscillations in the context of online motor performance in common source space across subjects. Specifically, the extent and distinct role of medial parietal cortex to sensorimotor beta connectivity and local domain broadband activity combine in a time and frequency manner to assist ballistic movements. These findings can serve as a model to examine whether similar source space EEG dynamics exhibit different time-frequency changes in individuals with neurological disorders that cause movement errors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the complex hierarchical topology of functional brain networks is a key aspect of functional connectivity research. Such topics are obscured by the widespread use of sparse binary network models which are fundamentally different to the complete weighted networks derived from functional connectivity.
NEW METHODS: We introduce two techniques to probe the hierarchical complexity of topologies. Firstly, a new metric to measure hierarchical complexity; secondly, a Weighted Complex Hierarchy (WCH) model. To thoroughly evaluate our techniques, we generalise sparse binary network archetypes to weighted forms and explore the main topological features of brain networks - integration, regularity and modularity - using curves over density.
RESULTS: By controlling the parameters of our model, the highest complexity is found to arise between a random topology and a strict 'class-based' topology. Further, the model has equivalent complexity to EEG phase-lag networks at peak performance.
COMPARISON TO EXISTING METHODS: Hierarchical complexity attains greater magnitude and range of differences between different networks than the previous commonly used complexity metric and our WCH model offers a much broader range of network topology than the standard scale-free and small-world models at a full range of densities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our metric and model provide a rigorous characterisation of hierarchical complexity. Importantly, our framework shows a scale of complexity arising between 'all nodes are equal' topologies at one extreme and 'strict class-based' topologies at the other.},

While initial work has established generally good reproducibility for a limited selection of these graph theoretical measures, there remains an obvious need to document the reproducibility of a more extensive array of commonly used graph metrics. We sought to evaluate the test-retest reliability of a much richer suite of graph theoretic measures as applied to weighted networks derived from high-density resting-state human EEG. Our findings were promising overall, with some important qualifications when considering the frequency bands of interest and the method used to calculate functional connectivity as well as some substantial variance between individual graph metrics. In general, the reliability of networks in the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ frequency bands was improved when functional connectivity was defined solely on the basis of relative phase distributions. In the $\delta$ and \texttheta{} bands, reliability was substantially better when functional connectivity was based on coherence, which incorporates both phase and amplitude information.},

  abstract = {Background
In view of age-related brain changes, identifying factors that are associated with healthy aging are of great interest. In the present study, we compared the functional brain network characteristics of three groups of healthy older participants aged 61\textendash{}75~years who had a different cognitive and motor training history (multi-domain group: participants who had participated in a multi-domain training; visuomotor group: participants who had participated in a visuomotor training; control group: participants with no specific training history). The study's basic idea was to examine whether these different training histories are associated with differences in behavioral performance as well as with task-related functional brain network characteristics. Based on a high-density electroencephalographic measurement one~year after training, we calculated graph-theoretical measures representing the efficiency of functional brain networks.

Results
Behaviorally, the multi-domain group performed significantly better than the visuomotor and the control groups on a multi-domain task including an inhibition domain, a visuomotor domain, and a spatial navigation domain. In terms of the functional brain network features, the multi-domain group showed significantly higher functional connectivity in a network encompassing visual, motor, executive, and memory-associated brain areas in the theta frequency band compared to the visuomotor group. These brain areas corresponded to the multi-domain task demands. Furthermore, mean connectivity of this network correlated positively with performance across both the multi-domain and the visuomotor group. In addition, the multi-domain group showed significantly enhanced processing efficiency reflected by a higher mean weighted node degree (strength) of the network as compared to the visuomotor group.

Conclusions
Taken together, our study shows expertise-dependent differences in task-related functional brain networks. These network differences were evident even a year after the acquisition of the different expertise levels. Hence, the current findings can foster understanding of how expertise is positively associated with brain functioning during aging.},

  abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and fMRI experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

Most broadly, this hierarchy exhibits a dichotomy between two opposed systems (Fox et al., 2005). One system engages with the environment and includes the visual, auditory, and sensorimotor (SMN) networks as well as the dorsal attention network (DAN), which controls spatial attention. The other system includes the default mode network (DMN) and the fronto-parietal control system (FPC), RSNs that instantiate episodic memory and executive control, respectively. Here, we test the hypothesis, based on the spectral specificity of electrophysiologic responses to perceptual vs. memory tasks (Klimesch, 1999; Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999), that these two large-scale neural systems also manifest frequency specificity in the resting state. We measured the spatial correspondence between electrocorticographic (ECoG) band-limited power (BLP) and R-fMRI correlation patterns in awake, resting, human subjects. Our results show that, while gamma BLP correspondence was common throughout the brain, theta (4-8Hz) BLP correspondence was stronger in the DMN and FPC, whereas alpha (8-12Hz) correspondence was stronger in the SMN and DAN. Thus, the human brain, at rest, exhibits frequency specific electrophysiology, respecting both the spectral structure of task responses and the hierarchical organization of RSNs.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of small-world and scale-free networks the study of complex systems from a network perspective has taken an enormous flight. In recent years many important properties of complex networks have been delineated. In particular, significant progress has been made in understanding the relationship between the structural properties of networks and the nature of dynamics taking place on these networks. For instance, the 'synchronizability' of complex networks of coupled oscillators can be determined by graph spectral analysis. These developments in the theory of complex networks have inspired new applications in the field of neuroscience. Graph analysis has been used in the study of models of neural networks, anatomical connectivity, and functional connectivity based upon fMRI, EEG and MEG. These studies suggest that the human brain can be modelled as a complex network, and may have a small-world structure both at the level of anatomical as well as functional connectivity. This small-world structure is hypothesized to reflect an optimal situation associated with rapid synchronization and information transfer, minimal wiring costs, as well as a balance between local processing and global integration. The topological structure of functional networks is probably restrained by genetic and anatomical factors, but can be modified during tasks. There is also increasing evidence that various types of brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, brain tumours and epilepsy may be associated with deviations of the functional network topology from the optimal small-world pattern.},

  abstract = {Objective:
To address the problem of volume conduction and active reference electrodes in the assessment of functional connectivity, we propose a novel measure to quantify phase synchronization, the phase lag index (PLI), and compare its performance to the well-known phase coherence (PC), and to the imaginary component of coherency (IC).
Methods:
The PLI is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of phase differences between two signals. The performance of PLI, PC, and IC was examined in (i) a model of 64 globally coupled oscillators, (ii) an EEG with an absence seizure, (iii) an EEG data set of 15 Alzheimer patients and 13 control subjects, and (iv) two MEG data sets.
Results:
PLI and PC were more sensitive than IC to increasing levels of true synchronization in the model. PC and IC were influenced stronger than PLI by spurious correlations because of common sources. All measures detected changes in synchronization during the absence seizure. In contrast to PC, PLI and IC were barely changed by the choice of different montages. PLI and IC were superior to PC in detecting changes in beta band connectivity in AD patients. Finally, PLI and IC revealed a different spatial pattern of functional connectivity in MEG data than PC.
Conclusion:
The PLI performed at least as well as the PC in detecting true changes in synchronization in model and real data but, at the same token and like-wise the IC, it was much less affected by the influence of common sources and active reference electrodes.

  abstract = {Several methods have been applied to EEG or MEG signals to detect functional networks. In recent works using MEG/EEG and fMRI data, temporal ICA analysis has been used to extract spatial maps of resting-state networks with or without an atlas-based parcellation of the cortex. Since the links between the fMRI signal and the electromagnetic signals are not fully established, and to avoid any bias, we examined whether EEG alone was able to derive the spatial distribution and temporal characteristics of functional networks. To do so, we propose a two-step original method: 1) An individual multi-frequency data analysis including EEG-based source localisation and spatial independent component analysis, which allowed us to characterize the resting-state networks. 2) A group-level analysis involving a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify reproducible large-scale networks across the population. Compared with large-scale resting-state networks obtained with fMRI, the proposed EEG-based analysis revealed smaller independent networks thanks to the high temporal resolution of EEG, hence hierarchical organization of networks. The comparison showed a substantial overlap between EEG and fMRI networks in motor, premotor, sensory, frontal, and parietal areas. However, there were mismatches between EEG-based and fMRI-based networks in temporal areas, presumably resulting from a poor sensitivity of fMRI in these regions or artefacts in the EEG signals. The proposed method opens the way for studying the high temporal dynamics of networks at the source level thanks to the high temporal resolution of EEG. It would then become possible to study detailed measures of the dynamics of connectivity.},

  abstract = {Summary
Higher brain function relies upon the ability to flexibly integrate information across specialized communities of brain regions; however, it is unclear how this mechanism manifests over time. In this study, we used time-resolved network analysis of fMRI data to demonstrate that the human brain traverses~between functional states that maximize either segregation into tight-knit communities or integration across otherwise disparate neural regions. Integrated states enable faster and more accurate performance on a cognitive task, and are associated with dilations in pupil diameter, suggesting that ascending neuromodulatory systems may govern the transition between these alternative~modes of brain function. Together, our results confirm a direct link between cognitive performance and the dynamic reorganization of the network structure of the brain.},

  abstract = {The human brain is able to exceed modern computers on multiple computational demands (e.g., language, planning) using a small fraction of the energy. The mystery of how the brain can be so efficient is compounded by recent evidence that all brain regions are constantly active as they interact in so-called resting-state networks (RSNs). To investigate the brain's ability to process complex cognitive demands efficiently, we compared functional connectivity (FC) during rest and multiple highly distinct tasks. We found previously that RSNs are present during a wide variety of tasks and that tasks only minimally modify FC patterns throughout the brain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, although subtle, these task-evoked FC updates from rest nonetheless contribute strongly to behavioral performance. One might expect that larger changes in FC reflect optimization of networks for the task at hand, improving behavioral performance. Alternatively, smaller changes in FC could reflect optimization for efficient (i.e., small) network updates, reducing processing demands to improve behavioral performance. We found across three task domains that high-performing individuals exhibited more efficient brain connectivity updates in the form of smaller changes in functional network architecture between rest and task. These smaller changes suggest that individuals with an optimized intrinsic network configuration for domain-general task performance experience more efficient network updates generally. Confirming this, network update efficiency correlated with general intelligence. The brain's reconfiguration efficiency therefore appears to be a key feature contributing to both its network dynamics and general cognitive ability.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The brain's network configuration varies based on current task demands. For example, functional brain connections are organized in one way when one is resting quietly but in another way if one is asked to make a decision. We found that the efficiency of these updates in brain network organization is positively related to general intelligence, the ability to perform a wide variety of cognitively challenging tasks well. Specifically, we found that brain network configuration at rest was already closer to a wide variety of task configurations in intelligent individuals. This suggests that the ability to modify network connectivity efficiently when task demands change is a hallmark of high intelligence.},

In a paradigm requiring sustained vigilance for instance, we previously observed that higher prestimulus activity in a cingulo-insular-thalamic network facilitated subsequent perception. Here, we test our proposed interpretation that this network underpins maintenance of tonic alertness. We used simultaneous acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) in the absence of any paradigm to test an ensuing hypothesis, namely that spontaneous fluctuations in this ICN${'}$s activity (as measured by fMRI) should show a positive correlation with the electrical signatures of tonic alertness (as recorded by concurrent EEG). We found in human subjects (19 male, 7 female) that activity in a network comprising dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, anterior prefrontal cortex and thalamus is positively correlated with global field power (GFP) of upper alpha band (10\textendash{}12 Hz) oscillations, the most consistent electrical index of tonic alertness. Conversely, and in line with earlier findings, alpha band power was negatively correlated with activity in another ICN, the so-called dorsal attention network which is most prominently involved in selective spatial attention. We propose that the cingulo-insular-thalamic network serves maintaining tonic alertness through generalized expression of cortical alpha oscillations. Attention is mediated by activity in other systems, e.g., the dorsal attention network for space, selectively disrupts alertness-related suppression and hence manifests as local attenuation of alpha activity.},

  abstract = {The goal of the present study was to examine relationships between individual differences in resting state functional connectivity as ascertained by fMRI (rs-fcMRI) and performance on tasks of executive function (EF), broadly defined as the ability to regulate thoughts and actions. Unlike most previous research that focused on the relationship between rs-fcMRI and a single behavioral measure of EF, in the current study we examined the relationship of rs-fcMRI with individual differences in subcomponents of EF. Ninety-one adults completed a resting state fMRI scan and three separate EF tasks outside the magnet: inhibition of prepotent responses, task set shifting, and working memory updating. From these three measures, we derived estimates of common aspects of EF, as well as abilities specific to working memory updating and task shifting. Using Independent Components Analysis (ICA), we identified across the group of participants several networks of regions (Resting State Networks, RSNs) with temporally correlated time courses. We then used dual regression to explore how these RSNs covaried with individual differences in EF. Dual regression revealed that increased higher common EF was associated with connectivity of a) frontal pole with an attentional RSN, and b) Crus I and II of the cerebellum with the right frontoparietal RSN. Moreover, higher shifting-specific abilities were associated with increased connectivity of angular gyrus with a ventral attention RSN. The results of the current study suggest that the organization of the brain at rest may have important implications for individual differences in EF, and that individuals higher in EF may have expanded resting state networks as compared to individuals with lower EF.},

  abstract = {Studies of human intelligence provide strong evidence for the neural efficiency hypothesis, which suggests more efficient brain functioning (i.e., less or more focused activation) in more intelligent individuals. Recent studies have specified the scope of the neural efficiency hypothesis by suggesting that the relationship between brain activation and intelligence only holds true for problems of moderate difficulty and can be altered through training and is only found in frontal brain regions. We investigated the moderating roles of task difficulty and training on the neural efficiency phenomenon in the context of working memory (WM) training.

In two studies of 54 participants (study 1) and 29 participants (study 2), cortical activation was assessed by means of electroencephalography (EEG), or more precisely by means of event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the upper alpha band. ERD was assessed during the performance of WM tasks in a pre-test \textendash{} training \textendash{} post-test design, comparing groups of lower and higher intelligence.

We found supportive evidence for the neural efficiency hypothesis only in moderately difficult WM tasks in frontal brain regions, even in the absence of performance differences. There was no effect of intelligence on the simple or highly demanding, adaptive WM tasks. In the latter task, however, an intelligence-related difference emerged at the behavioral level, but training did not modulate the relationship between intelligence and brain activation.

These results corroborate the moderating role of task difficulty in the neural efficiency hypothesis in the context of WM demands and suggest that training does not impact the neural efficiency phenomenon in the context of WM demands.},

In this experiment, positron emission tomography (PET) data were gathered on participants (N = 28) who solved easy and hard problems that were tailored to the participants' own ability levels, thereby eliminating aptitude group differences in effort requirements.

  abstract = {Abstract``Is there a biology of intelligence which is characteristic of the normal human nervous system?'' Here we review 37 modern neuroimaging studies in an attempt to address this question posed by Halstead (1947) as he and other icons of the last century endeavored to understand how brain and behavior are linked through the expression of intelligence and reason. Reviewing studies from functional (i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) and structural (i.e., magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, voxel-based morphometry) neuroimaging paradigms, we report a striking consensus suggesting that variations in a distributed network predict individual differences found on intelligence and reasoning tasks. We describe this network as the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT). The P-FIT model includes, by Brodmann areas (BAs): the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BAs 6, 9, 10, 45, 46, 47), the inferior (BAs 39, 40) and superior (BA 7) parietal lobule, the anterior cingulate (BA 32), and regions within the temporal (BAs 21, 37) and occipital (BAs 18, 19) lobes. White matter regions (i.e., arcuate fasciculus) are also implicated. The P-FIT is examined in light of findings from human lesion studies, including missile wounds, frontal lobotomy/leukotomy, temporal lobectomy, and lesions resulting in damage to the language network (e.g., aphasia), as well as findings from imaging research identifying brain regions under significant genetic control. Overall, we conclude that modern neuroimaging techniques are beginning to articulate a biology of intelligence. We propose that the P-FIT provides a parsimonious account for many of the empirical observations, to date, which relate individual differences in intelligence test scores to variations in brain structure and function. Moreover, the model provides a framework for testing new hypotheses in future experimental designs., AbstractLest the conjunction ``intelligence and reasoning'' seduce readers into supposing that the two are of a piece, we point out that analyses made at the superset level concerning intelligence do not readily align with or outperform the scientific advances made via investigations of reasoning, which at best can be viewed as a subset of intelligent behaviour., AbstractHigh-order constructs such as intelligence result from the interaction of numerous processing systems, one of which is language. However, in determining the role of language in intelligence, attention must be paid to evidence from lesion studies and, in particular, evidence of dissociation of functions where high-order cognition can be demonstrated in face of profound aphasia., AbstractA parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) model of human intelligence has been proposed based on a review of neuroimaging literature and lesion studies. The P-FIT model provides an important basis for future research. Future studies involving connectivity analyses and an integrative approach of imaging modalities using the P-FIT model should provide vastly increased understanding of the biological bases of intelligence., AbstractJung \& Haier (J\&H) have done an admirable job of solving the wrong problem. Their article does not show ``where in the brain is intelligence,'' because intelligence resides not in the brain but, rather, in the interaction of brain and environment. I describe four reasons why the article does not adequately localize intelligence in the brain., AbstractA large number of experimental results clearly indicate that sleep has an important role for human intelligence. Sleep-wake stages and their specific patterns of brain activation and neuromodulation subserve human memory, states of consciousness, and modes of information processing that strongly relate to intelligence. Therefore, human intelligence should be explained in a broader framework than is implicated by neuroimaging data alone., AbstractA large body of evidence supports the idea that a common fronto-parietal network is activated across a range of diverse cognitive functions. Jung \& Haier's (J\&H's) review demonstrates a very similar pattern of activity, which correlates with individual differences in intelligence. We propose that these converging lines of evidence are best interpreted as a general role of the fronto-parietal network in integration and control., AbstractGeneral intelligence is largely based on two distinguishable mental abilities: crystallized intelligence (gC) and fluid reasoning ability (gF). The target article authors' P-FIT model emphasizes a network of regions throughout the brain as the neural basis for fluid reasoning and/or working memory. However, it provides little significant insight into the neural basis of gC, or how or why gC is more stable than gF across the life span., AbstractIntelligence studies are confounded by an inability to image the mind, as well as by heterogeneity in intelligence constructs, gender, and age. The ghost (of future, not past) sitting at the table is a molecular one. Biochemistry and molecular biology factors can contribute to or take away from intelligence to a great and not yet fully explored extent., Abstract``Where in the brain is intelligence?'' is an intriguing question, and Jung \& Haier (J\&H) resist the temptation to provide a simple answer. Their concept tries to integrate and transcend previous findings, and, while omitting the contributions from complementary methods, results seem to converge. Whether similarities or differences in such networks are more important, though, is still open for discussion., AbstractThe target article provides a thoughtful review and synthesis of studies examining the neural basis of cognitive abilities associated with intelligence test performance. In its attempt to present a new or generative theory of the neural basis for intelligence, however, the review faces specific limits to its theoretical model that relate to processes of development and the role of automaticity in cognition., AbstractOverall mean performance on intelligence tests by brain-damaged patients with focal lesions can be misleading in regard to localization of intelligence. The widely used WAIS has many subtests that together recruit spatially distant neural ``centers,'' but individually the subtests reveal localized functions. Moreover, there are kinds of intelligence that defy the localizationist approach inferred from brain damage., AbstractNeuroimaging evidence, both within and between research strategies, is largely heterogeneous. This results from the way the construct of interest (i.e., intelligence) is measured. Every single available measure comprises several cognitive abilities, although the so-called g factor is always present. Here I suggest that studies must always control for this empirical fact to arrive at solid conclusions., AbstractRecent brain imaging points to differences in brain structure that relate to intelligence, but how do we model their causal relationship within a coherent framework that circumvents classic dualist traps? A bottom-level nonlinear, dynamic, multifactor, multiplicative, multidimensional, molecular (ND4M) trait-covariance time-space model may accomplish this better than traditional approaches., AbstractThe commentaries address conceptual issues ranging from our narrow focus on neuroimaging to the various definitions of intelligence. The integration of the P-FIT and data from cognitive neuroscience is particularly important and considerable consistency is found. Overall, the commentaries affirm that advances in neuroscience techniques have caused intelligence research to enter a new phase. The P-FIT is recognized as a reasonable empirical framework to test hypotheses about the relationship of brain structure and function with intelligence and reasoning., AbstractA well-recognized framework for modeling human intelligence centers around Spearman's g, a common central factor accounting for individual differences in cognitive performance across a variety of complex tasks (Spearman 1904). The neural basis of g may be better characterized by posterior-frontal integration, rather than parietal, which may be just one of many posterior regions that are controlled by the prefrontal cortex (PFC)., AbstractPerformance on abstract unfamiliar tasks used to measure intelligence has not been found to correlate with individual differences in highly skilled and expert performance. Given that cognitive and neural structures and regions mediating performance change as skill increases, the structures highlighted by parieto-frontal integration theory are unlikely to account for individual differences in skilled cognitive achievement in everyday life., AbstractThis commentary compares the P-FIT model with psychometric and developmental models of intelligence and shows that there are isomorphisms and divergences between them. All three models involve some common dimensions, but the P-FIT model lacks many of the dimensions of the other models. Then we point to research that can lead to the integration of brain models with cognitive-developmental models., AbstractThe P-FIT model is a major step forward in understanding biological causes of intelligence. It is consistent with evidence on the influence of working memory and speediness upon intelligence, and with models that emphasize the role of interaction between modules to produce intelligence. The contribution to understanding genetic contributions is problematical, due to the difficulty of isolating the genes involved., AbstractIn this commentary we make two rejoinders to Jung \& Haier (J\&H). First, we highlight the response selection component in tasks as a confounding variable that may explain the parieto-frontal involvement in studies of human intelligence. Second, we suggest that efficient response selection may be an integral part of the definition of intelligence., AbstractThe difficulty of making reliable interpretation from a dense cloud of unreliable correlations means that the grounds for making a testable ``biological,'' or brain-based, theory of intelligence remain very shaky. We briefly discuss the conceptual and methodological problems that arise and suggest one possible alternative interpretation of the data.},

  abstract = {The ERP components and variations of spatial complexity or functional connectivity are two distinct dimensions of neurophysiological events in the visual Go/Nogo task. Extensive studies have been conducted on these two distinct dimensions; however, no study has investigated whether these two neurophysiological events are linked to each other in the visual Go/Nogo task. The relationship between spatial complexity of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, quantified by the measure omega complexity, and event-related potential (ERP) components in a visual Go/Nogo task was studied. We found that with the increase of spatial complexity level, the latencies of N1 and N2 component were shortened and the amplitudes of N1, N2, and P3 components were decreased. The anterior Go/Nogo N2 effect and the Go/Nogo P3 effect were also found to be decreased with the increase of EEG spatial complexity. In addition, the reaction times in high spatial complexity trials were significantly shorter than those of medium and low spatial complexity trials when the time interval used to estimate the EEG spatial complexity was extended to 0$\sim$1,000 ms after stimulus onset. These results suggest that high spatial complexity may be associated with faster cognitive processing and smaller postsynaptic potentials that occur simultaneously in large numbers of cortical pyramidal cells of certain brain regions. The EEG spatial complexity is closely related with demands of certain cognitive processes and the neural processing efficiency of human brain.
NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The reaction times, the latencies/amplitudes of event-related potential (ERP) components, the Go/Nogo N2 effect, and the Go/Nogo P3 effect are linked to the electroencephalographic (EEG) spatial complexity level. The EEG spatial complexity is closely related to demands of certain cognitive processes and could reflect the neural processing efficiency of human brain. Obtaining the single-trial ERP features through single-trial spatial complexity may be a more efficient approach than traditional methods.},

  abstract = {Our goal is to study the human brain anatomical network. For this, the anatomical connection probabilities (ACP) between 90 cortical and subcortical brain gray matter areas are estimated from diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) techniques. The ACP between any two areas gives the probability that those areas are connected at least by a single nervous fiber. Then, the brain is modeled as a non-directed weighted graph with continuous arc weights given by the ACP matrix. Based on this approach, complex networks properties such as small-world attributes, efficiency, degree distribution, vulnerability, betweenness centrality and motifs composition are studied. The analysis was carried out for 20 right-handed healthy subjects (mean age: 31.10, S.D.: 7.43). According to the results, all networks have small-world and broad-scale characteristics. Additionally, human brain anatomical networks present bigger local efficiency and smaller global efficiency than the corresponding random networks. In a vulnerability and betweenness centrality analysis, the most indispensable and critical anatomical areas were identified: putamens, precuneus, insulas, superior parietals and superior frontals. Interestingly, some areas have a negative vulnerability (e.g. superior temporal poles, pallidums, supramarginals and hechls), which suggest that even at the cost of losing in global anatomical efficiency, these structures were maintained through the evolutionary processes due to their important functions. Finally, symmetrical characteristic building blocks (motifs) of size 3 and 4 were calculated, obtaining that motifs of size 4 are the expanded version of motif of size 3. These results are in agreement with previous anatomical studies in the cat and macaque cerebral cortex.},

The angular gyrus also is thought to have functional links with posterior language areas (e.g., Wernicke's area), because it is presumed to be involved in mapping visually presented inputs onto linguistic representations. Using positron emission tomography , we demonstrate in normal men that regional cerebral blood flow in the left angular gyrus shows strong within-task, across-subjects correlations (i.e., functional connectivity) with regional cerebral blood flow in extrastriate occipital and temporal lobe regions during single word reading. In contrast, the left angular gyrus is functionally disconnected from these regions in men with persistent developmental dyslexia, suggesting that the anatomical disconnection of the left angular gyrus from other brain regions that are part of the ``normal'' brain reading network in many cases of acquired alexia is mirrored by its functional disconnection in developmental dyslexia.},

A new study in eight normal men reports widespread significant GMR decreases following learning a complex task (the computer game ``Tetris''). The purpose of this study is to ascertain the correlations between GMR changes following learning ``Tetris'' and psychometric intelligence scores (RAPM and WAIS-R) to determine whether high-ability subjects show the largest GMR decreases, as predicted by a brain efficiency hypothesis. This hypothesis is supported with significant correlations between the magnitude of GMR change and intelligence scores in many brain areas that changed with learning. Some implications for the role of attention, memory, and speed of processing are discussed in view of the specific brain areas involved.},

  abstract = {Superior cognitive performance can be viewed from an intelligence perspective, emphasising general properties of the human information processing system (such as mental speed and working memory), and from an expertise perspective, highlighting the indispensable role of elaborated domain-specific knowledge and acquired skills. In exploring its neurophysiological basis, recent research has provided considerable evidence of the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence, indicating lower and more focussed brain activation in brighter individuals. The present EEG study investigates the impacts of intelligence and expertise on cognitive performance and the accompanying cortical activation patterns in the domain of tournament chess. Forty-seven tournament chess players of varying intelligence and expertise level worked on tasks drawing on mental speed, memory, and reasoning. Half of the tasks were representative for chess, while the other half was not. The cortical activation was quantified by means of event-related desynchronisation (ERD) in the upper alpha band. Independent effects of expertise and intelligence emerged at both, the performance and the neurophysiological level. Brighter participants performed better than less intelligent ones which was associated with more efficient brain functioning (lower ERD) across all tasks. Additionally, a high expertise level was beneficial for good task performance but exerted a topographically differentiated influence on the cortical activation patterns. The findings suggest that superior cognitive performance and the underlying cortical activation are not only a function of knowledge and domain-specific competences but also of the general efficiency of the information processing system.},

  abstract = {The world is aging and, as the elderly population increases, age-related cognitive decline emerges as a major concern. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allow the investigation of the neural bases of age-related cognitive changes in vivo. Typically, fMRI studies map brain activity while subjects perform cognitive tasks, but such paradigms are often difficult to implement on a wider basis. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has emerged as an important alternative modality of fMRI data acquisition, during which no specific task is required. Due to such simplicity and the reliability of rs-fMRI data, this modality presents increased feasibility and potential for clinical application in the future. With rs-fMRI, fluctuations in regional brain activity can be detected across separate brain regions and the patterns of intercorrelation between the functioning of these regions are measured, affording quantitative indices of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). This review article summarizes the results of recent rs-fMRI studies that have documented a variety of aging-related RSFC changes in the human brain, discusses the neurophysiological hypotheses proposed to interpret such findings, and provides an overview of the future, highly promising perspectives in this field.},

In an fMRI-study, 58 persons with lower (n = 28) or respectively higher (n = 30) intelligence worked on simple and difficult inductive reasoning tasks having the same person-specific task difficulty. Consequently, less bright individuals received sample-based easy and medium tasks, whereas bright subjects received sample-based medium and difficult tasks. This design also allowed a comparison of lower versus higher intelligent individuals when working on the same tasks (i.e. sample-based medium task difficulty). In line with expectations, differences in task performance and in brain activation were only found for the subset of tasks with the same sample-based task difficulty, but not when comparing tasks with the same person-specific task difficulty.

Studies from our laboratory have shown that good performers show a larger upper alpha ERD (interpreted in terms of larger cortical activation) than bad performers. In contrast, other researchers found evidence for the neural efficiency hypothesis, which states that more intelligent subjects exhibit a smaller extent of cortical activation, which is assumed to be reflected by a smaller upper alpha ERD. Here we address the question whether these divergent results may be due to differences in general task difficulty. Using a modified version of the RAVEN, individually divided into easy and difficult tasks, a group of average and a group of highly intelligent subjects (IQ- and IQ+) have been investigated. While in the theta frequency IQ+ subjects generally exhibited a significantly stronger activation, we found a significant interaction of task difficulty and IQ group in the upper alpha band, indicating both, a weaker activation for the high IQ group during the easy tasks, and a significant increase from easy to difficult tasks for IQ+ only.},

We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2\textendash{}12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In subjects performing no specific cognitive task (``resting state''), time courses of voxels within functionally connected regions of the brain have high cross-correlation coefficients (``functional connectivity''). The purpose of this study was to measure the contributions of low frequencies and physiological noise to cross-correlation maps.
METHODS: In four healthy volunteers, task-activation functional MR imaging and resting-state data were acquired. We obtained four contiguous slice locations in the ``resting state'' with a high sampling rate. Regions of interest consisting of four contiguous voxels were selected. The correlation coefficient for the averaged time course and every other voxel in the four slices was calculated and separated into its component frequency contributions. We calculated the relative amounts of the spectrum that were in the low-frequency (0 to 0.1 Hz), the respiratory-frequency (0.1 to 0.5 Hz), and cardiac-frequency range (0.6 to 1.2 Hz).
RESULTS: For each volunteer, resting-state maps that resembled task-activation maps were obtained. For the auditory and visual cortices, the correlation coefficient depended almost exclusively on low frequencies ($<$0.1 Hz). For all cortical regions studied, low-frequency fluctuations contributed more than 90\% of the correlation coefficient. Physiological (respiratory and cardiac) noise sources contributed less than 10\% to any functional connectivity MR imaging map. In blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, physiological noise contributed more to the correlation coefficient.
CONCLUSION: Functional connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor cortices is characterized predominantly by frequencies slower than those in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In functionally connected regions, these low frequencies are characterized by a high degree of temporal coherence.},

These nexuses are intriguing because of their potential role in integration and also because they may augment metabolic cascades relevant to brain disease. To identify regions of high connectivity in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a computationally-efficient approach to map the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain. Analysis of two separate fMRI datasets (each n=24) demonstrated hubs throughout heteromodal areas of association cortex. Prominent hubs were located within posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal cortices. Network analysis revealed that many, but not all, hubs were located within regions previously implicated as components of the default network. A third dataset (n=12) demonstrated that the locations of hubs were present across passive and active task states suggesting that they reflect a stable property of cortical network architecture. To obtain an accurate reference map, data were combined across 127 participants to yield a consensus estimate of cortical hubs. Using this consensus estimate, we explored whether the topography of hubs could explain the pattern of vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as some models suggest that regions of high activity and metabolism accelerate pathology. PET amyloid imaging in AD (n=10) as compared to older controls (n=29) showed high A$\beta$ deposition in the locations of cortical hubs consistent with the possibility that hubs, while acting as critical waystations for information processing, may also augment the underlying pathological cascade in AD.},

  abstract = {The network architecture of the human brain has become a feature of increasing interest to the neuroscientific community, largely because of its potential to illuminate human cognition, its variation over development and aging, and its alteration in disease or injury. Traditional tools and approaches to study this architecture have largely focused on single scales\textemdash{}of topology, time, and space. Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this review on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the multi-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to multi-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and multi-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for such structures, survey network-based methodological approaches to reveal these structures, and outline current frontiers and open questions. Although predominantly peppered with examples from human neuroimaging, we hope that this account will offer an accessible guide to any neuroscientist aiming to measure, characterize, and understand the full richness of the brain's multiscale network structure\textemdash{}irrespective of species, imaging modality, or spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Previous studies on individual differences in intelligence and brain activation during cognitive processing focused on brain regions where activation increases with task demands (task-positive network, TPN). Our study additionally considers brain regions where activation decreases with task demands (task-negative network, TNN) and compares effects of intelligence on neural effort in the TPN and the TNN. In a sample of 52 healthy subjects, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine changes in neural effort associated with the processing of a working memory task. The task comprised three conditions of increasing difficulty: (a) maintenance, (b) manipulation, and (c) updating of a four-letter memory set. Neural effort was defined as signal increase in the TPN and signal decrease in the TNN, respectively. In both functional networks, TPN and TNN, neural effort increased with task difficulty. However, intelligence, as assessed with Raven's Matrices, was differentially associated with neural effort in the TPN and TNN. In the TPN, we observed a positive association, while we observed a negative association in the TNN. In terms of neural efficiency (i.e., task performance in relation to neural effort expended on task processing), more intelligent subjects (as compared to less intelligent subjects) displayed lower neural efficiency in the TPN, while they displayed higher neural efficiency in the TNN. The results illustrate the importance of differentiating between TPN and TNN when interpreting correlations between intelligence and fMRI measures of brain activation. Importantly, this implies the risk of misinterpreting whole brain correlations when ignoring the functional differences between TPN and TNN.},

The currently most popular theory of the neural bases of intelligence \textendash{} the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory of Intelligence (P-FIT) \textendash{} describes a network of frontal and parietal brain regions as the main neural basis of intelligence. Here, we put the theory to an empirical test by conducting voxel-based quantitative meta-analyses of 12 structural and 16 functional human brain imaging studies, testing for statistically significant spatial convergence across studies. We focused our analyses on studies reporting associations between individual differences in intelligence (as assessed by established tests of psychometric intelligence) and either (a) brain activation during a cognitive task (functional meta-analysis) or (b) amount of grey matter as assessed by voxel-based morphometry (structural meta-analysis). The functional meta-analysis resulted in eight clusters distributed across both hemispheres, located in lateral frontal, medial frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. The structural meta-analysis of VBM studies resulted in 12 clusters distributed in lateral and medial frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, as well as in subcortical structures. Results of the functional and structural meta-analyses did not show any overlap \textemdash{} although both independently showed good match with the P-FIT. Based on the meta-analyses, we present an updated model for the brain bases of intelligence that extends previous models in also considering the posterior cingulate cortex and subcortical structures as relevant for intelligence, and in differentiating between positive and negative associations of intelligence and brain activation. From a critical review of original studies and methods, we derive important suggestions for future research on brain correlates of intelligence.},

  abstract = {Measures of interaction (connectivity) of the EEG are at the forefront of current neuroscientific research. Unfortunately, test-retest reliability can be very low, depending on the measure and its estimation, the EEG-frequency of interest, the length of the signal, and the population under investigation. In addition, artefacts can hamper the continuity of the EEG signal, and in some clinical situations it is impractical to exclude artefacts. We aimed to examine factors that moderate test-retest reliability of measures of interaction. The study involved 40 patients with a range of neurological diseases and memory impairments (age median: 60; range 21-76; 40\% female; 22 mild cognitive impairment, 5 subjective cognitive complaints, 13 temporal lobe epilepsy), and 20 healthy controls (age median: 61.5; range 23-74; 70\% female). We calculated 14 measures of interaction based on the multivariate autoregressive model from two EEG-recordings separated by two weeks. We characterised test-retest reliability by correlating the measures between the two EEG-recordings for variations of data length, data discontinuity, artefact exclusion, model order, and frequency over all combinations of channels and all frequencies, individually for each subject, yielding a correlation coefficient for each participant. Excluding artefacts had strong effects on reliability of some measures, such as classical, real valued coherence (\textasciitilde{}0.1 before, \textasciitilde{}0.9 after artefact exclusion). Full frequency directed transfer function was highly reliable and robust against artefacts. Variation of data length decreased reliability in relation to poor adjustment of model order and signal length. Variation of discontinuity had no effect, but reliabilities were different between model orders, frequency ranges, and patient groups depending on the measure. Pathology did not interact with variation of signal length or discontinuity. Our results emphasise the importance of documenting reliability, which may vary considerably between measures of interaction. We recommend careful selection of measures of interaction in accordance with the properties of the data. When only short data segments are available and when the signal length varies strongly across subjects after exclusion of artefacts, reliability becomes an issue. Finally, measures which show high reliability irrespective of the presence of artefacts could be extremely useful in clinical situations when exclusion of artefacts is impractical.},

Using the principles of electric field topographical analysis, it is possible to estimate the meta-stable states of the brain (i.e., the resting state topographies, so-called microstates). We estimated seven resting state topographies explaining the EEG dataset with k-means clustering (N=164, 256 electrodes). Using a method specifically designed to localize the sources of broadband EEG scalp topographies by matching sensor and source space temporal patterns, we demonstrated that we can estimate the EEG resting state networks reliably by measuring the reproducibility of our findings. After subtracting their mean from the seven EEG resting state networks, we identified seven state-specific networks. The mean map includes regions known to be densely anatomically and functionally connected (superior frontal, superior parietal, insula, and anterior cingulate cortices). While the mean map can be interpreted as a ``router'', cross-linking multiple functional networks, the seven state-specific resting state networks partly resemble and extend previous fMRI-based networks estimated as the hemodynamic correlates of four canonical EEG microstates.},

Functional imaging data acquired for 54 healthy adult participants during wakeful rest were modeled as graphs representing individual functional brain networks. Nodal and global measures of efficient network organization (i.e., nodal efficiency and global efficiency) were correlated with intelligence scores (IQ from the Wechsler Abbreviate Scale of Intelligence, WASI). While global efficiency showed no significant association with intelligence, the nodal efficiency was significantly associated with intelligence in three brain regions. Participants with higher IQ scores showed higher nodal efficiency in right anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), two hub regions of a functional brain network previously described as salience network. Furthermore, higher IQ was associated with lower nodal efficiency in the left temporo-parietal junction area (TPJ). Distinct connectivity profiles were observed for brain regions showing a positive versus negative correlation between IQ and nodal efficiency. Our analyses suggest that intrinsic (i.e., task-independent) connectivity profiles of brain regions that have previously been associated with salience processing (AI and dACC) and the filtering of irrelevant information from higher-level processing (TPJ), play a role in explaining individual differences in intelligence. Based on these intelligence-related effects in resting-state fMRI data, we discuss the potential relevance of processing salient information for the explanation of differences in cognitive performance and intelligence.},

The fact that people think or behave differently from one another is rooted in individual differences in brain anatomy and connectivity. Here, we used repeated-measurement resting-state functional MRI to explore intersubject variability in connectivity. Individual differences in functional connectivity were heterogeneous across the cortex, with significantly higher variability in heteromodal association cortex and lower variability in unimodal cortices. Intersubject variability in connectivity was significantly correlated with the degree of evolutionary cortical expansion, suggesting a potential evolutionary root of functional variability. The connectivity variability was also related to variability in sulcal depth but not cortical thickness, positively correlated with the degree of long-range connectivity but negatively correlated with local connectivity. A meta-analysis further revealed that regions predicting individual differences in cognitive domains are predominantly located in regions of high connectivity variability. Our findings have potential implications for understanding brain evolution and development, guiding intervention, and interpreting statistical maps in neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {The principles by which networks of neurons compute, and how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) of synaptic weights generates and maintains their computational function, are unknown. Preceding work has shown that soft winner-take-all (WTA) circuits, where pyramidal neurons inhibit each other via interneurons, are a common motif of cortical microcircuits. We show through theoretical analysis and computer simulations that Bayesian computation is induced in these network motifs through STDP in combination with activity-dependent changes in the excitability of neurons. The fundamental components of this emergent Bayesian computation are priors that result from adaptation of neuronal excitability and implicit generative models for hidden causes that are created in the synaptic weights through STDP. In fact, a surprising result is that STDP is able to approximate a powerful principle for fitting such implicit generative models to high-dimensional spike inputs: Expectation Maximization. Our results suggest that the experimentally observed spontaneous activity and trial-to-trial variability of cortical neurons are essential features of their information processing capability, since their functional role is to represent probability distributions rather than static neural codes. Furthermore it suggests networks of Bayesian computation modules as a new model for distributed information processing in the cortex.},

Traditionally associated with sensorimotor functions, beta oscillations have recently become more broadly implicated in top-down processing, long-range communication, and preservation of the current brain state. Here, we extend and refine these views based on accumulating new findings of content-specific beta-synchronization during endogenous information processing in working memory (WM) and decision making. We characterize such content-specific beta activity as short-lived, flexible network dynamics supporting the endogenous (re)activation of cortical representations. Specifically, we suggest that beta-mediated ensemble formation within and between cortical areas may awake, rather than merely preserve, an endogenous cognitive set in the service of current task demands. This proposal accommodates key aspects of content-specific beta modulations in monkeys and humans, integrates with timely computational models, and outlines a functional role for beta that fits its transient temporal characteristics.},

  abstract = {Objective
There are two inter-related categories of EEG measurement: 1, EEG currents or power and; 2, EEG network properties such as coherence and phase delays. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of these two different categories of EEG measurement to predict performance on the Weschler Intelligence test (WISC-R).
Methods
Resting eyes closed EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations with a linked ears reference from 442 subjects aged 5\textendash{}52 years. The Weschler Intelligence test was administered to the same subjects but not while the EEG was recorded. Subjects were divided into high IQ ($\geq$120) and low IQ ($\leq$90) groups. EEG variables at P\&lt;.05 were entered into a factor analysis and then the single highest loading variable on each factor was entered into a discriminant analysis where groups were high IQ vs. low.Q.
Results
Discriminant analysis of high vs. low IQ was 92.81\textendash{}97.14\% accurate. Discriminant scores of intermediate IQ subjects (i.e. 90\&lt;IQ\&lt;120) were intermediate between the high and low IQ groups. Linear regression predictions of IQ significantly correlated with the discriminant scores (r=0.818\textendash{}0.825, P\&lt;10-6). The ranking of effect size was EEG phase\&gt;EEG coherence\&gt;EEG amplitude asymmetry\&gt;absolute power\&gt;relative power and power ratios. The strongest correlations to IQ were short EEG phase delays in the frontal lobes and long phase delays in the posterior cortical regions, reduced coherence and increased absolute power.
Conclusions
The findings are consistent with increased neural efficiency and increased brain complexity as positively related to intelligence, and with frontal lobe synchronization of neural resources as a significant contributing factor to EEG and intelligence correlations.
Significance
Quantitative EEG predictions of intelligence provide medium to strong effect size estimates of cognitive functioning while simultaneously revealing a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological substrates of intelligence.},

The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between EEG phase reset and performance on the Wechsler Intelligence test.
Methods
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 378 subjects ranging in age from 5~years to 17.6~years. The Wechsler Intelligence test (WISC-R) was administered to the same subjects on the same day but not while the EEG was recorded. Complex demodulation was used to compute instantaneous EEG phase differences between pairs of electrodes and the 1st and 2nd derivatives were used to measure phase reset by phase shift duration and phase lock duration. The dependent variable was full scale I.Q. and the independent variables were phase shift duration (SD) and phase lock duration (LD) with age as a covariate.
Results
Phase shift duration (40\textendash{}90~ms) was positively related to intelligence (P \&lt; .00001) and the phase lock duration (100\textendash{}800~ms) was negatively related to intelligence (P \&lt; .00001). Phase reset in short interelectrode distances (6~cm) was more highly correlated to I.Q. (P \&lt; .0001) than in long distances (\&gt; 12~cm).
Conclusions
The duration of unstable phase dynamics and phase locking represent a bounded optimization process, for example, too long a duration of phase locking then less flexibility and too short of a phase shift then reduced neural resources. A two compartmental model of local field coupling and neuron synchrony to a preferred phase was developed to explain the findings.},

Fifteen right-handed healthy adult volunteers underwent to this study. Compared with sham stimulation, magnetic stimulation (1 Hz for 1 min) over both left and right AG, but not over FEF or intraparietal sulcus, core regions of the dorsal attention network, enhanced the dominant alpha power density (8-10 Hz) in occipitoparietal cortex.

A common misconception is that the dependence revealed by these measures must be specific to the spectral range of the filtered input signals. Implicitly or explicitly, obtaining analytic phase involves normalizing the signal by its own envelope, which is a nonlinear operation that introduces broad spectral leakage. We review how this generates bias and complicates the interpretation of commonly used measures of phase locking. A specific example of this effect may create spurious phase locking as a consequence of nonzero circular mean in the phase of input signals, which can be viewed as spectral leakage to 0 Hz. Corrections for this problem which recenter or uniformize the distribution of phase may fail when the amplitudes of the compared signals are correlated. To address the more general problem of spectral bias, a novel measure of phase locking is proposed, the amplitude-weighted phase locking value (awPLV). This measure is closely related to coherence, but it removes ambiguities of interpretation that detract from the latter.},

  abstract = {The relevance of correlations between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes across the brain acquired at rest (resting state networks, or RSN) to functional networks was tested using two quantitative criteria: (1) the localisation of major RSN correlation clusters and the task-related maxima defined in BOLD fMRI signal changes from the same subjects; and (2) the relative hemispheric lateralisation (LI) of BOLD fMRI signal changes in sensorimotor cortex. RSN were defined on the basis of signal changes correlated with that of a ``seed'' voxel in the primary sensorimotor cortex. We found a generally close spatial correspondence between clusters of correlated BOLD signal change in RSN and activation maxima associated with hand movement. Conventional BOLD fMRI during active hand movement showed the expected wide variation in relative hemispheric lateralisation of LI for sensorimotor cortex across the subjects. There was a good correlation between LIs for the active hand movement task and the RSN (r=0.74, p$<$0.001). The RSN thus define anatomically relevant regions of motor cortex and change with functionally relevant variations in hemispheric lateralisation of sensorimotor cortical interactions with hand movement.},

  title = {Functional Connectivity Hubs in the Human Brain - {{Semantic Scholar}}},
  abstract = {Brain networks appear to have few and well localized regions with high functional connectivity density (hubs) for fast integration of neural processing, and their dysfunction could contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases. However the variability in the distribution of these brain hubs is unknown due in part to the overwhelming computational demands associated to their localization. Recently we developed a fast algorithm to map the local functional connectivity density (lFCD). Here we extend our method to map the global density (gFDC) taking advantage of parallel computing. We mapped the gFCD in the brain of 1031 subjects from the 1000 Functional Connectomes project and show that the strongest hubs are located in regions of the default mode network (DMN) and in sensory cortices, whereas subcortical regions exhibited the weakest hubs. The strongest hubs were consistently located in ventral precuneus/cingulate gyrus (previously identified by other analytical methods including lFCD) and in primary visual cortex (BA 17/18), which highlights their centrality to resting connectivity networks. In contrast and after rescaling, hubs in prefrontal regions had lower gFCD than lFCD, which suggests that their local functional connectivity (as opposed to long-range connectivity) prevails in the resting state. The power scaling of the probability distribution of gFCD hubs (as for lFCD) was consistent across research centers further corroborating the \&quot;scale-free\&quot; topology of brain networks. Within and between-subject variability for gFCD were twice than that for lFCD (20\% vs. 12\% and 84\% vs. 34\%, respectively) suggesting that gFCD is more sensitive to individual differences in functional connectivity.},

  abstract = {The human brain relies upon the dynamic formation and dissolution of a hierarchy of functional networks to support ongoing cognition. However, how functional connectivities underlying such networks are supported by cortical microstructure remains poorly understood. Recent animal work has demonstrated that electrical activity promotes myelination. Inspired by this, we test a hypothesis that gray-matter myelin is related to electrophysiological connectivity. Using ultra-high field MRI and the principle of structural covariance, we derive a structural network showing how myelin density differs across cortical regions and how separate regions can exhibit similar myeloarchitecture. Building upon recent evidence that neural oscillations mediate connectivity, we use magnetoencephalography to elucidate networks that represent the major electrophysiological pathways of communication in the brain. Finally, we show that a significant relationship exists between our functional and structural networks; this relationship differs as a function of neural oscillatory frequency and becomes stronger when integrating oscillations over frequency bands. Our study sheds light on the way in which cortical microstructure supports functional networks. Further, it paves the way for future investigations of the gray-matter structure/function relationship and its breakdown in pathology.},

Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure\textendash{}function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

However, the association between the local connectivity within a specific brain region and intelligence during rest remains largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between local connectivity and intelligence. Fifty-nine right-handed healthy adults participated in the study. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to assess the strength of local connectivity. The associations between ReHo and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) scores were studied in a voxel-wise manner using partial correlation analysis controlling for age and sex. We found that the FSIQ scores were positively correlated with the ReHo values of the bilateral inferior parietal lobules, middle frontal, parahippocampal and inferior temporal gyri, the right thalamus, superior frontal and fusiform gyri, and the left superior parietal lobule. The main findings are consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) of intelligence, supporting the view that general intelligence involves multiple brain regions throughout the brain.},

  abstract = {We explored properties of whole brain networks based on multivariate spectral analysis of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series measured in 90 cortical and subcortical subregions in each of five healthy volunteers studied in the (no-task) resting state. We note that undirected graphs representing conditional independence between multivariate time-series can be more readily approached in the frequency domain than the time domain. Estimators of partial coherency and normalized partial mutual information $\phi$, an integrated measure of partial coherence over an arbitrary frequency band, are applied. Using these tools, we replicate the prior observations that bilaterally homologous brain regions tend to be strongly connected and functional connectivity is generally greater at low frequencies [0.0004, 0.1518 Hz]. We also show that long-distance intrahemispheric connections between regions of prefrontal and parietal cortex were more salient at low frequencies than at frequencies greater than 0.3 Hz, whereas many local or short-distance connections, such as those comprising segregated dorsal and ventral paths in posterior cortex, were also represented in the graph of high-frequency connectivity. We conclude that the partial coherency spectrum between a pair of human brain regional fMRI time-series depends on the anatomical distance between regions: long-distance (greater than 7 cm) edges represent conditional dependence between bilaterally symmetric neocortical regions, and between regions of prefrontal and parietal association cortex in the same hemisphere, are predominantly subtended by low-frequency components.},

In particular, it proved possible to recover fast stimulus-locked modulations of "effective connectivity," even if they were masked by strong direct stimulus modulations of individual firing rates. These procedures thus present a clearly superior alternative to the commonly used "shift predictor." 5. Adopting a model-based approach, we generalize the classical measures for quantifying a direct interneuronal connection ("efficacy" and "contribution") to include possible stimulus-locked time variations. 6.

  abstract = {Cortical functional connectivity, as indicated by the concurrent spontaneous activity of spatially segregated regions, is being studied increasingly because it may determine the reaction of the brain to external stimuli and task requirements and it is reportedly altered in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), such functional connectivity is investigated commonly by correlating the time course of a chosen ``seed voxel'' with the remaining voxel time courses in a voxel-by-voxel manner. This approach is biased by the actual choice of the seed voxel, however, because it only shows functional connectivity for the chosen brain region while ignoring other potentially interesting patterns of coactivation. We used spatial independent component analysis (sICA) to assess cortical functional connectivity maps from resting state data. SICA does not depend on any chosen temporal profile of local brain activity. We hypothesized that sICA would be able to find functionally connected brain regions within sensory and motor regions in the absence of task-related brain activity. We also investigated functional connectivity patterns of several parietal regions including the superior parietal cortex and the posterior cingulate gyrus. The components of interest were selected in an automated fashion using predefined anatomical volumes of interest. SICA yielded connectivity maps of bilateral auditory, motor and visual cortices. Moreover, it showed that prefrontal and parietal areas are also functionally connected within and between hemispheres during the resting state. These connectivity maps showed an extremely high degree of consistency in spatial, temporal, and frequency parameters within and between subjects. These results are discussed in the context of the recent debate on the functional relevance of fluctuations of neural activity in the resting state. Hum.

Among the brain regions implicated in this network, several, including the posterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobes, have also shown decreased metabolism early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reasoned that default-mode network activity might therefore be abnormal in AD. To test this hypothesis, we used independent component analysis to isolate the network in a group of 13 subjects with mild AD and in a group of 13 age-matched elderly controls as they performed a simple sensory-motor processing task. Three important findings are reported. Prominent coactivation of the hippocampus, detected in all groups, suggests that the default-mode network is closely involved with episodic memory processing. The AD group showed decreased resting-state activity in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, suggesting that disrupted connectivity between these two regions accounts for the posterior cingulate hypometabolism commonly detected in positron emission tomography studies of early AD. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis applied at the individual subject level suggests that activity in the default-mode network may ultimately prove a sensitive and specific biomarker for incipient AD.},

  abstract = {The human brain has been documented to be spatially organized in a finite set of specific coherent patterns, namely resting state networks (RSNs). The interactions among RSNs, being potentially dynamic and directional, may not be adequately captured by simple correlation or anticorrelation. In order to evaluate the possible effective connectivity within those RSNs, we applied a conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to the RSNs retrieved by independent component analysis (ICA) from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our analysis provided evidence for specific causal influences among the detected RSNs: default-mode, dorsal attention, core, central-executive, self-referential, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks. In particular, we identified that self-referential and default-mode networks (DMNs) play distinct and crucial roles in the human brain functional architecture. Specifically, the former RSN exerted the strongest causal influence over the other RSNs, revealing a top-down modulation of self-referential mental activity (SRN) over sensory and cognitive processing. In quite contrast, the latter RSN was profoundly affected by the other RSNs, which may underlie an integration of information from primary function and higher level cognition networks, consistent with previous task-related studies. Overall, our results revealed the causal influences among these RSNs at different processing levels, and supplied information for a deeper understanding of the brain network dynamics.},

The functional networks identified are typically bilaterally distributed across the cerebral hemispheres, show similarity to known white matter connections (Greicius et al., 2009), and are seen even in anesthetized monkeys (Vincent et al., 2007). Yet it remains unclear how they arise. Here we tested two distinct possibilities: (1) functional networks arise largely from structural connectivity constraints, and generally require direct interactions between functionally coupled regions mediated by white-matter tracts; and (2) functional networks emerge flexibly with the development of normal cognition and behavior and can be realized in multiple structural architectures. We conducted resting-state fMRI in eight adult humans with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) and normal intelligence, and compared their data to those from eight healthy matched controls. We performed three main analyses: anatomical region-of-interest-based correlations to test homotopic functional connectivity, independent component analysis (ICA) to reveal functional networks with a data-driven approach, and ICA-based interhemispheric correlation analysis. Both groups showed equivalently strong homotopic BOLD correlation. Surprisingly, almost all of the group-level independent components identified in controls were observed in AgCC and were predominantly bilaterally symmetric. The results argue that a normal complement of resting-state networks and intact functional coupling between the hemispheres can emerge in the absence of the corpus callosum, favoring the second over the first possibility listed above.},

Accordingly, knowledge of functional connectivity between brain regions is crucial to understanding perception, cognition, and behavior. Functional connectivity methods estimate similarities between activity recorded in different regions of the brain. They are often applied to resting state activity, thus providing measures that are by nature task independent. The spatial patterns revealed by functional connectivity are not only shaped by the underlying anatomical structure of the brain but also partially depend on the history of task-driven coactivations. Inter-subject differences in functional connectivity may, at least to some degree, underlie variability observed in task performance across healthy subjects and in behavioral impairments in neurological patients. In this respect, recent studies have demonstrated that behavioral deficits in patients with brain injury are not only due to local tissue damage but also due to altered functional connectivity among structurally intact regions connected to the damaged site. Studies based on functional connectivity have the potential to advance basic understanding of how brain lesions induce neuropsychological syndromes. Furthermore, they may eventually suggest improved rehabilitation strategies for patients with brain injury, through the design of individualized treatment and recovery protocols.},

However, the relationship of functional connectivity to structural connectivity remains unclear. If functional connectivity relies on structural connectivity, then anatomical isolation of a brain region should eliminate functional connectivity with other brain regions. We tested this by measuring functional connectivity of the surgically disconnected temporal pole in resection patients (N=5; mean age 37; 2F, 3M). Functional connectivity was evaluated based on coactivation of whole-brain fMRI data with the average low-frequency BOLD signal from disconnected tissue in each patient. In sharp contrast to our prediction, we observed significant functional connectivity between the disconnected temporal pole and remote brain regions in each disconnection case. These findings raise important questions about the neural bases of functional connectivity measures derived from the fMRI BOLD signal.},

The results show a striking regularity: for many demands, there is a similar recruitment of mid-dorsolateral, mid-ventrolateral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Much of the remainder of frontal cortex, including most of the medial and orbital surfaces, is largely insensitive to these demands. Undoubtedly, these results provide strong evidence for regional specialization of function within prefrontal cortex. This specialization, however, takes an unexpected form: a specific frontal-lobe network that is consistently recruited for solution of diverse cognitive problems.},

RSNs are not caused by signal artifacts due to low sampling rate (aliasing); ii. they are localized primarily to the cerebral cortex; iii. similar RSNs also can be identified in perfusion fMRI data; and iv. at least 5 distinct RSN patterns are reproducible across different subjects. The RSNs appear to reflect ``default'' interactions related to functional networks related to those recruited by specific types of cognitive processes. RSNs are a major source of non-modeled signal in BOLD fMRI data, so a full understanding of their dynamics will improve the interpretation of functional brain imaging studies more generally. Because RSNs reflect interactions in cognitively relevant functional networks, they offer a new approach to the characterization of state changes with pathology and the effects of drugs.},

  abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

  abstract = {Many functional imaging studies have been performed to explore the neural basis of intelligence by detecting brain activity changes induced by intelligence-related tasks, such as reasoning or working memory. However, little is known about whether the spontaneous brain activity at rest is relevant to the differences in intelligence. Here, 59 healthy adult subjects (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale score, 90\textendash{}138) were studied with resting state fMRI. We took the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) as the seed regions and investigated the correlations across subjects between individual intelligence scores and the strength of the functional connectivity (FC) between the seed regions and other brain regions. We found that the brain regions in which the strength of the FC significantly correlated with intelligence scores were distributed in the frontal, parietal, occipital and limbic lobes. Stepwise linear regression analysis also revealed that the FCs within the frontal lobe and between the frontal and posterior brain regions were both important predictive factors for the differences in intelligence. These findings support a network view of intelligence, as suggested in previous studies. More importantly, our findings suggest that brain activity may be relevant to the differences in intelligence even in the resting state and in the absence of an explicit cognitive demand. This could provide a new perspective for understanding the neural basis of intelligence.},

In the absence of task, stimuli, or explicit mnemonic demands, robust correlations were observed between activity in the HF and several parietal regions (including precuneus, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobule). These HF-correlated regions in parietal cortex were spatially distinct from those correlated with the motion-sensitive MT+ complex. Reanalysis of event-related fMRI studies of recognition memory showed that the regions spontaneously correlated with the HF (but not MT+) were also modulated during directed recollection. These regions showed greater activity to successfully recollected items as compared with other trial types. Together, these results associate specific regions of parietal cortex that are sensitive to successful recollection with the HF.},

However, the functional and anatomical connectivities between hippocampus and other regions are rarely concurrently investigated in schizophrenia. In the present study, both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed on 17 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 14 healthy subjects. Resting-state functional connectivities of the bilateral hippocampi were separately analyzed by selecting the anterior hippocampus as region of interest. The fornix body was reconstructed by diffusion tensor tractography, and the integrity of this tract was evaluated using fractional anisotropy (FA). In patients with schizophrenia, the bilateral hippocampi showed reduced functional connectivities to some regions which have been reported to be involved in episodic memory, such as posterior cingulate cortex, extrastriate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and parahippocampus gyrus. We speculated that these reduced connectivity may reflect the disconnectivity within a neural network related to the anterior hippocampus in schizophrenia. Meanwhile the mean FA of the fornix body was significantly reduced in patients, indicating the damage in the hippocampal anatomical connectivity in schizophrenia. The concurrence of the functional disconnectivity and damaged anatomical connectivity between the hippocampus and other regions in schizophrenia suggest that the functional\textendash{}anatomical relationship need to be further investigated.},

Emphasis is placed on the points of contact between the apparently diverse applications of these concepts and in particular the central role of eigenimages or spatial modes.

Here, we provide more evidence on this phenomenon, extending the previous work to networks that interpolate between homogeneous and heterogeneous topologies. We also introduce details of the path towards synchronization for the evolution of clustering in the synchronized patterns. Finally, we investigate the synchronization of networks with modular structure and conclude that, in these cases, local synchronization is first attained at the most internal level of organization of modules, progressively evolving to the outer levels as the coupling constant is increased. The present work introduces parameters that are proved to be useful for the characterization of synchronization phenomena in complex networks.},

The most striking discovery is that the whole-brain network exhibits ``small-world'' properties shared with many other complex systems (social, technological, information, biological). This topology allows a high efficiency at different spatial and temporal scale with a very low wiring and energy cost. Its modular organization also allows for a high level of adaptation. In addition, degree distribution of brain networks demonstrates highly connected hubs that are crucial for the whole-network functioning. Many of these hubs have been identified in regions previously defined as belonging to the default-mode network (potentially explaining the high basal metabolism of this network) and the attentional networks. This could explain the crucial role of these hub regions in physiology (task-related fMRI data) as well as in pathophysiology. Indeed, such topological definition provides a reliable framework for predicting behavioral consequences of focal or multifocal lesions such as stroke, tumors or multiple sclerosis. It also brings new insights into a better understanding of pathophysiology of many neurological or psychiatric diseases affecting specific local or global brain networks such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. Graph theoretical analysis of connectivity MRI data provides an outstanding framework to merge anatomical and functional data in order to better understand brain pathologies.},

People with higher psychometric intelligence have, on average, larger brains, and possibly faster neural conduction speed. A few small functional brain-scanning studies suggest that, in healthy individuals, people who are of higher IQ have lower cerebral metabolic rates during mentally active conditions.

Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated gender effects on not only focal brain areas but also the connectivity between areas. Specifically, structural MRI and diffusion MRI data have revealed substantial gender differences in white matter\textendash{}based anatomical connectivity. Structural MRI data further demonstrated gender differences in the connectivity revealed by morphometric correlation among brain areas. Functional connectivity derived from functional neuroimaging (e.g., functional MRI and PET) data is also modulated by gender. Moreover, male and female human brains display differences in the network topology that represents the organizational patterns of brain connectivity across the entire brain. In this review, the authors summarize recent findings in the multimodal brain connectivity/network research with gender, focusing on large-scale data sets derived from modern neuroimaging techniques. The literature provides convergent evidence for a substantial gender difference in brain connectivity within the human brain that possibly underlies gender-related cognitive differences. Therefore, it should be mandatory to take gender into account when designing experiments or interpreting results of brain connectivity/network in health and disease. Future studies will likely be conducted to explore the interdependence between gender-related brain connectivity/network and the gender-specific nature of brain diseases as well as to investigate gender-related characteristics of multimodal brain connectivity/network in the normal brain.},

Metabolic connectivity, a correlation between FDG uptake in PCC and MPFC, was examined in groups of subjects with (relative to median) low (n = 18) and high (n = 17) performance on digit span backward test as an index of verbal WM. In addition, fiber tractography based on PCC and MPFC nodes as way points was performed in a subset of subjects.
FDG uptake in the DMN nodes did not differ between high and low performers. However, significantly (p = 0.01) lower metabolic connectivity was found in the group of low performers. Furthermore, as compared to high performers, low performers showed lower density of the left superior cingulate bundle.
Verbal WM performance is related to metabolic and structural connectivity within the DMN in young healthy adults. Metabolic connectivity as quantified with FDG-PET might be a sensitive marker of the normal variability in some cognitive functions.},

  abstract = {The number of different cortical structures in mammalian brains and the number of extrinsic fibres linking these regions are both large. As with any complex system, systematic analysis is required to draw reliable conclusions about the organization of the complex neural networks comprising these numerous elements. One aspect of organization that has long been suspected is that cortical networks are organized into `streams' or `systems'. Here we report computational analyses capable of showing whether clusters of strongly interconnected areas are aspects of the global organization of cortical systems in macaque and cat. We used two different approaches to analyse compilations of corticocortical connection data from the macaque and the cat. The first approach, optimal set analysis, employed an explicit definition of a neural `system' or `stream', which was based on differential connectivity. We defined a two\textendash{}component cost function that described the cost of the global cluster arrangement of areas in terms of the areas` connectivity within and between candidate clusters. Optimal cluster arrangements of cortical areas were then selected computationally from the very many possible arrangements, using an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The second approach, non\textendash{}parametric cluster analysis (NPCA), grouped cortical areas on the basis of their proximity in multidimensional scaling representations. We used non\textendash{}metric multidimensional scaling to represent the cortical connectivity structures metrically in two and five dimensions. NPCA then analysed these representations to determine the nature of the clusters for a wide range of different cluster shape parameters. The results from both approaches largely agreed. They showed that macaque and cat cortices are organized into densely intra\textendash{}connected clusters of areas, and identified the constituent members of the clusters. These clusters reflected functionally specialized sets of cortical areas, suggesting that structure and function are closely linked at this gross, systems level.},

  abstract = {Global structural brain connectivity has been reported to be sex-dependent with women having increased interhemispheric connectivity (InterHc) and men having greater intrahemispheric connectivity (IntraHc). However, (a) smaller brains show greater InterHc, (b) larger brains show greater IntraHc, and (c) women have, on average, smaller brains than men. Therefore, sex differences in brain size may modulate sex differences in global brain connectivity. At the behavioural level, sex-dependent differences in connectivity are thought to contribute to men-women differences in spatial and verbal abilities. But this has never been tested at the individual level. The current study assessed whether individual differences in global structural connectome measures (InterHc, IntraHc and the ratio of InterHc relative to IntraHc) predict spatial and verbal ability while accounting for the effect of sex and brain size. The sample included forty men and forty women, who did neither differ in age nor in verbal and spatial latent components defined by a broad battery of tests and tasks. High-resolution T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained for computing brain size and reconstructing the structural connectome. Results showed that men had higher IntraHc than women, while women had an increased ratio InterHc/IntraHc. However, these sex differences were modulated by brain size. Increased InterHc relative to IntraHc predicted higher spatial and verbal ability irrespective of sex and brain size. The positive correlations between the ratio InterHc/IntraHc and the spatial and verbal abilities were confirmed in 1000 random samples generated by bootstrapping. Therefore, sex differences in global structural connectome connectivity were modulated by brain size and did not underlie sex differences in verbal and spatial abilities. Rather, the level of dominance of InterHc over IntraHc may be associated with individual differences in verbal and spatial abilities in both men and women.},

  abstract = {Neuro-imaging studies of intelligence implicate the importance of a parietal\textendash{}frontal network. One unresolved issue is whether this network underlies a general factor of intelligence (g) or other specific cognitive factors. A second unresolved issue is whether males and females use different parts of this network. Here we obtained intelligence factors (general, speed of reasoning, spatial, memory, and numerical) from a large set of tests completed by 6929 young adults, 40 of whom (21 males, 19 females) also completed DTI and fMRI during a working memory n-back task. Within brain areas activated during this task, correlations were computed between percent activation and scores on the intelligence factors. The main findings were: (1) individual differences in activation during the n-back task were correlated to the general intelligence factor (g), as well as to distilled estimates (removing g) of speed of reasoning, numerical ability, and spatial ability, but not to memory, (2) the correlations were mainly bilateral for females and unilateral for males, and (3) differences in the integrity of the axonal connections were also related to the functional findings showing that integrity of interhemispheric connections was positively correlated to some intelligence factors in females but negatively correlated in males. This study illustrates the potential for identifying aspects of the neural basis of intelligence using a combination of structural and functional imaging.},

We assessed white matter integrity voxelwise using diffusion tensor imaging at high magnetic field (4 Tesla), in 92 identical and fraternal twins. White matter integrity, quantified using fractional anisotropy (FA), was used to fit structural equation models (SEM) at each point in the brain, generating three-dimensional maps of heritability. We visualized the anatomical profile of correlations between white matter integrity and full-scale, verbal, and performance intelligence quotients (FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ). White matter integrity (FA) was under strong genetic control and was highly heritable in bilateral frontal (a2 = 0.55, p = 0.04, left; a2 = 0.74, p = 0.006, right), bilateral parietal (a2 = 0.85, p $<$ 0.001, left; a2 = 0.84, p $<$ 0.001, right), and left occipital (a2 = 0.76, p = 0.003) lobes, and was correlated with FIQ and PIQ in the cingulum, optic radiations, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, internal capsule, callosal isthmus, and the corona radiata (p = 0.04 for FIQ and p = 0.01 for PIQ, corrected for multiple comparisons). In a cross-trait mapping approach, common genetic factors mediated the correlation between IQ and white matter integrity, suggesting a common physiological mechanism for both, and common genetic determination. These genetic brain maps reveal heritable aspects of white matter integrity and should expedite the discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting fiber connectivity and cognition.},

  abstract = {A possible relationship between cognitive abilities and white matter structure as assessed by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was investigated in the pediatric population. DTI was performed on 47 normal children ages 5\textendash{}18. Using a voxelwise analysis technique, the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were tested for significant correlations with Wechsler full-scale IQ scores, with subject age and gender used as covariates. Regions displaying significant positive correlations of IQ scores with FA were found bilaterally in white matter association areas, including frontal and occipito-parietal areas. No regions were found exhibiting correlations of IQ with MD except for one frontal area significantly overlapping a region containing a significant correlation with FA. The positive direction of the correlation with FA is the same as that found previously with age, and indicates a positive relationship between fiber organization and/or density with cognitive function. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that regionally specific increased fiber organization is a mechanism responsible for the normal development of white matter tracts.

Graphical models represent a convenient vehicle to formalize experimental findings and to closely and quantitatively characterize the various networks identified. Underlying these abstract concepts are anatomical networks, the so-called connectome, which can be investigated by functional imaging techniques as well. Future studies have to bridge the gap between anatomical neuronal connections and related functional or effective connectivities.},

  title = {Hierarchical Organization of Human Cortical Networks in Health and Schizophrenia. - {{Semantic Scholar}}},
  abstract = {The complex organization of connectivity in the human brain is incompletely understood. Recently, topological measures based on graph theory have provided a new approach to quantify large-scale cortical networks. These methods have been applied to anatomical connectivity data on nonhuman species, and cortical networks have been shown to have small-world topology, associated with high local and global efficiency of information transfer. Anatomical networks derived from cortical thickness measurements have shown the same organizational properties of the healthy human brain, consistent with similar results reported in functional networks derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalographic data. Here we show, using anatomical networks derived from analysis of inter-regional covariation of gray matter volume in MRI data on 259 healthy volunteers, that classical divisions of cortex (multimodal, unimodal, and transmodal) have some distinct topological attributes. Although all cortical divisions shared nonrandom properties of small-worldness and efficient wiring (short mean Euclidean distance between connected regions), the multimodal network had a hierarchical organization, dominated by frontal hubs with low clustering, whereas the transmodal network was assortative. Moreover, in a sample of 203 people with schizophrenia, multimodal network organization was abnormal, as indicated by reduced hierarchy, the loss of frontal and the emergence of nonfrontal hubs, and increased connection distance. We propose that the topological differences between divisions of normal cortex may represent the outcome of different growth processes for multimodal and transmodal networks and that neurodevelopmental abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically impact multimodal cortical organization.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0165-0173(98)00056-3},
  abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

During interocular rivalry, there is competition between the two nonfusible stimuli presented to the two eyes, and only one stimulus is selected at any time. We biased this competition in three different ways: (1) we exploited the condition that in strabismic cats there is often one dominant eye that is selected for most of the time. (2) We presented the two stimuli with a temporal offset, which biases competition in favor of the newly appearing stimulus. (3) We presented the two stimuli with highly different contrasts, which biases competition in favor of the stimulus with higher contrast. Whenever competition was biased in favor of the stimulus activating the recorded neurons, gamma-frequency synchronization of the respective responses was enhanced, and vice versa. Firing rates showed some differences between stimulation conditions. However, when present, these changes were inversely related to a competitive advantage of the respective stimulus. We hypothesize that enhanced gamma-frequency synchronization in primary visual cortex is a correlate of stimulus selection. Synchronization is likely to be translated into firing rate changes at later processing stages.},

Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.},

  shorttitle = {A Measure for Brain Complexity},
  abstract = {In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply with their global integration during perception and behavior. In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity (CN), that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. CN is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. CN is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of CN. The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.},

It has been proposed that long-range oscillatory synchronization is a major mode of coordinating such a distributed network. Here, intracranial recordings were made from three humans as they performed a challenging visual object-recognition task that required them to identify barely recognizable fragmented line-drawings of common objects. Subdural electrodes were placed over the prefrontal cortex and LOC, and depth electrodes were placed within the hippocampal formation. Robust beta-band coherence was evident in all subjects during processing of recognizable fragmented images. Significantly lower coherence was evident during processing of unrecognizable scrambled versions of the same. The results indicate that transient beta-band oscillatory coupling between these three distributed cortical regions may reflect a mechanism for effective communication during visual object processing.},

Analyses of material type showed the expected dorsal-ventral dissociation between spatial and nonspatial storage in the posterior cortex, but not in the frontal cortex. Some support was found for left frontal dominance in verbal WM, but only for tasks with low executive demand. Executive demand increased right lateralization in the frontal cortex for spatial WM. Tasks requiring executive processing generally produce more dorsal frontal activations than do storage-only tasks, but not all executive processes show this pattern. Brodmann's areas (BAs) 6, 8, and 9, in the superior frontal cortex, respond most when WM must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order must be maintained. Right BAs 10 and 47, in the ventral frontal cortex, respond more frequently with demand for manipulation (including dual-task requirements or mental operations). BA 7, in the posterior parietal cortex, is involved in all types of executive function. Finally, we consider a potential fourth executive function: selective attention to features of a stimulus to be stored in WM, which leads to increased probability of activating the medial prefrontal cortex (BA 32) in storage tasks.},

Second, it is shown that two prototypical measures of verbal and non-verbal g (i.e., vocabulary and block design) correlate with the amount of regional gray matter across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, suggesting that the general factor of intelligence relates to areas distributed across the brain as opposed to the view that g derives exclusively from the frontal lobes.},

Our critical review confirms the prevalent view that dorsolateral PFC circuitry is critical to executive-attention functions. Moreover, although the dorsolateral PFC is but one critical structure in a network of anterior and posterior ``attention control'' areas, it does have a unique executiveattention role in actively maintaining access to stimulus representations and goals in interference-rich contexts. Our review suggests the utility of an executive-attention framework for guiding future research on both PFC function and cognitive control.},

Instead they are associated with selective recruitment of lateral frontal cortex in one or both hemispheres. Despite very different task content in the three high-g\textendash{}low-g contrasts, lateral frontal recruitment is markedly similar in each case. Many previous experiments have shown these same frontal regions to be recruited by a broad range of different cognitive demands.

Although their functional role is unquestioned and their physiological origin is nowadays widely accepted, little is known about their relationship to neuronal activity. The combined recording of EEG and fMRI allows the temporal correlation between fluctuations of the RSNs and the dynamics of EEG spectral amplitudes. So far, only relationships between several EEG frequency bands and some RSNs could be demonstrated, but no study accounted for the spatial distribution of frequency domain EEG.   Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we report on the topographic association of EEG spectral fluctuations and RSN dynamics using EEG covariance mapping. All RSNs displayed significant covariance maps across a broad EEG frequency range. Cluster analysis of the found covariance maps revealed the common standard EEG frequency bands. We found significant differences between covariance maps of the different RSNs and these differences depended on the frequency band.   Conclusions/Significance Our data supports the physiological and neuronal origin of the RSNs and substantiates the assumption that the standard EEG frequency bands and their topographies can be seen as electrophysiological signatures of underlying distributed neuronal networks.},

We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function.

Recent evidence suggests a very high similarity between spontaneous and evoked brain activity in humans, implying that a fine characterization of brain dynamics recorded during resting-state might be informative for the understanding of evoked behavior. In a recent work, we listed and detailed the sets of regions showing robust co-activation during the solution of fluid intelligence (gf) tasks, decomposing such meta-analytic maps in stimulus- and reasoning stage-specific sub-maps. However, while anatomical overlap with well-known resting-state fMRI networks (RSNs) has been documented, we here propose a quantitative validation of such findings via functional connectivity analysis in a sample of healthy participants. Results highlight a striking degree of similarity between the connectivity profile of the gf network and that of the dorsal attention network, with additional overlap with the left and right fronto-parietal control networks. Interestingly, a strong negative correlation with structures of the default mode network (DMN) was also identified. Results of regression models built on two independent fMRI datasets confirmed the negative correlation between gf regions and medial prefrontal structures of the DMN as a significant predictor of individual gf scores. These might suggest a framework to interpret previously reported aging-related decline in both gf and the correlation between ``task-positive'' networks and DMN, possibly pointing to a common neurophysiological substrate.},

We begin by sketching a conceptual framework that views communication dynamics as a necessary link between the empirical domains of structural and functional connectivity. We then consider how different local and global topological attributes of structural networks support potential patterns of network communication, and how the interactions between network topology and dynamic models can provide additional insights and constraints. We end by proposing that communication dynamics may act as potential generative models of effective connectivity and can offer insight into the mechanisms by which brain networks transform and process information.},

  abstract = {Several non-invasive imaging methods have contributed to shed light on the brain mechanisms underlying working memory (WM). The aim of the present study was to depict the topology of the relevant EEG-derived brain networks associated to distinct operations of WM function elicited by the Sternberg Item Recognition Task (SIRT) such as encoding, storage and retrieval in healthy, middle age (46 $\pm$ 5yrs) adults. High density EEG recordings were performed in 17 participants whilst attending a visual SIRT. Neural correlates of WM were assessed by means of a combination of EEG signal processing methods (ie, time-varying connectivity estimation and graph theory), in order to extract synthetic descriptors of the complex networks underlying the encoding, storage and retrieval phases of WM construct. The group analysis revealed that the encoding phase exhibited a significantly higher small-world topology of EEG networks with respect to storage and retrieval in all EEG frequency band oscillations, thus indicating that during the encoding of items the global network organization could ``optimally'' promote the information flow between WM sub-networks. We also found that the magnitude of such configuration could predict subject behavioral performance when memory load increased as indicated by the negative correlation between Reaction Time and the local efficiency values estimated during the encoding in the alpha band in both 4 and 6 digits conditions. At the local scale, the values of the degree index which measures the degree of in- and out- information flow between scalp areas were found to specifically distinguish the hubs within the relevant sub-networks associated to each of the 3 different WM phases, according to the different role of the sub-network of regions in the different WM phases. Our findings indicate that the use of EEG-derived connectivity measures and their related topological indices might offer a reliable and yet affordable approach to monitor WM components and thus theoretically support the clinical assessment of cognitive functions in presence of WM decline/impairment, as it occurs after stroke.},

  abstract = {Ongoing neural dynamics comprise both frequency-specific oscillations and broadband-features, such as long-range dependence (LRD). Despite both being behaviorally relevant, little is known about their potential interactions. In humans, 8\textendash{}12 Hz $\alpha$ oscillations constitute the strongest deviation from 1/f power-law scaling, the signature of LRD. We postulated that $\alpha$ oscillations, believed to exert active inhibitory gating, downmodulate the temporal width of LRD in slower ongoing brain activity. In two independent ``resting-state'' datasets (electroencephalography surface recordings and magnetoencephalography source reconstructions), both across space and dynamically over time, power of $\alpha$ activity covaried with the power slope $<$5 Hz (i.e., greater $\alpha$ activity shortened LRD). Causality of $\alpha$ activity dynamics was implied by its temporal precedence over changes of slope. A model where power-law fluctuations of the $\alpha$ envelope inhibit baseline activity closely replicated our results. Thus, $\alpha$ oscillations may provide an active control mechanism to adaptively regulate LRD of brain activity at slow temporal scales, thereby shaping internal states and cognitive processes.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The two prominent features of ongoing brain activity are oscillations and temporal long-range dependence. Both shape behavioral performance, but little is known about their interaction. Here, we demonstrate such an interaction in EEG and MEG recordings of task-free human brain activity. Specifically, we show that spontaneous dynamics in alpha activity explain ensuing variations of dependence in the low and ultra-low-frequency range. In modeling, two features of alpha oscillations are critical to account for the observed effects on long-range dependence, scale-free properties of alpha oscillations themselves, and a modulation of baseline levels, presumably inhibitory. Both these properties have been observed empirically, and our study hence establishes alpha oscillations as a regulatory mechanism governing long-range dependence or ``memory'' in slow ongoing brain activity.},

Specifically, by examining EEG recordings of 50 people in resting state as well as during performance at two gf tasks we found converging evidence that high-gf participants display stronger Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) related to an increased concentration of gamma (\textasciitilde{}36Hz) spectral power at the descending phase of delta oscillations (\textasciitilde{}3Hz). Delta-gamma PAC strength explained 35\% variance in scores on multiple gf tests, outperforming six alternative EEG-based predictors including spectral power, complexity and amplitude-amplitude coupling.

These networks seem to be most engaged when persons are not involved in overt goal-directed behavior. These networks are also thought to underlie certain aspects of conscious introspection and to be specific to humans. Our paper provides a new explanation for rest state fluctuations by suggesting that they reflect a deeper biological principle of organization and are a consequence of the space\textendash{}time structure of primate anatomical connectivity. In a computational study using a biologically realistic primate cortical connectivity matrix, we show that the rest state networks emerge only if the time delays of signal transmission between brain areas are considered. The combination of anatomical structure and time delays creates a space\textendash{}time structure in which the neural noise enables the brain to explore various functional configurations representing its dynamic repertoire. The latter repertoire spans temporal scales of multiple orders of magnitude including scales observed in electric potentials and magnetic fields on the scalp, as well as in blood flow signals. Our results provide a testable explanation of the real-world phenomenon of rest state fluctuations in the primate brain.},

The most recent meta-analysis (Pietschnig, Penke, Wicherts, Zeiler, \& Voracek, 2015) reported a correlation of .24 between brain volume and intelligence \textendash{} notably lower than previous meta-analytic estimates. This headline meta-analytic result was based on a mixture of samples (healthy and clinical) and sample correlations not corrected for range restriction. Additionally, the role of IQ assessment quality was not considered. Finally, evidential value of the literature was not formally evaluated. Based on the results of our meta-analysis of the Pietschnig et al.'s sample data, the corrected correlation between brain volume and intelligence in healthy adult samples was r=.31 (k=32; N=1758). Furthermore, the quality of intelligence measurement was found to moderate the effect between brain volume and intelligence (b=.08, p=.028). Investigations that used `fair', `good', and `excellent' measures of intelligence yielded corrected brain volume and intelligence correlations of .23 (k=9; N=547), .32 (k=10; N=646), and .39 (k=13; N=565), respectively. The Henmi/Copas adjusted confidence intervals, the p-uniform results, and the p-curve results failed to suggest evidence of publication bias and/or p-hacking. The results were interpreted to suggest that the association between in vivo brain volume and intelligence is arguably best characterised as r$\approx$.40.

Several control analyses and the frequency specificity of network colocalization showed that the results were not trivial by-products of either brain dynamics or our analysis approach. Crucially, scale-free neuronal dynamics and connectivity also had colocalized modular structures at multiple levels of network organization, suggesting that modules of FC would be endowed with partially independent dynamic states.

The temporal decay of long-range temporal correlations in network metrics (LRTC) was quantified using the scaling exponent (SE) in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) plots. Having established the reliability of SE estimates as robust descriptors of network dynamics, we found that RD students displayed significantly reduced (a) overall sensor-level network organization across all frequency bands (global efficiency), and (b) temporal correlations between sensors covering the left temporoparietal region and the remaining sensors in the $\beta$3 band (local efficiency). Importantly, both groups displayed scale-free global network connectivity dynamics. The direct application of DFA to MEG signals failed to reveal significant group differences.

One plausible explanation for such variability may relate to different neuronal states defining the reactivity of the cortex to TMS. In this study intrinsic spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics were estimated with Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) in order to predict the inter-individual differences in the strength of intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) produced by paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS) of the left primary motor cortex. LRTC in the alpha frequency range were assessed from multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) obtained at rest before and after the application of and single-pulse TMS (spTMS) and ppTMS protocols. For the EEG session, preceding TMS application, we showed a positive correlation across subjects between the strength of ICF and LRTC in the fronto-central and parietal areas. This in turn attests to the existence of subject-specific neuronal phenotypes defining the reactivity of the brain to ppTMS. In addition, we also showed that ICF was associated with the changes in neuronal dynamics in the EEG session after the application of the stimulation. This result provides a complementary evidence for the recent findings demonstrating that the cortical stimulation with sparse non-regular stimuli might have considerable long-lasting effects on the cortical activity.},

Second time they had to determine if a target had changed in orientation, so the ongoing task involved memory retrieval. From multichannel EEG recorded during 200~ms intervals time-locked to fixation onsets, we estimated the functional connectivity using a weighted phase lag index at the frequencies of theta, alpha, and beta bands, and derived global and local measures of the functional connectivity graphs. We found differences between both memory task conditions for several network measures, such as mean path length, radius, diameter, closeness and eccentricity, mainly in the alpha band. Both the local and the global measures indicated that encoding involved a more segregated mode of operation than retrieval. These differences arose immediately after fixation onset and persisted for the entire duration of the lambda complex, an evoked potential commonly associated with early visual perception. We concluded that encoding and retrieval differentially shape network configurations involved in early visual perception, affecting the way the visual input is processed at each fixation. These findings demonstrate that task requirements dynamically control the functional connectivity networks involved in early visual perception.},

While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes. Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arise under different configurations of local dynamics and inter-system coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or non-stationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity and flexibility.

There are two inter-related categories of EEG measurement: 1, EEG currents or power and; 2, EEG network properties such as coherence and phase delays. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of these two different categories of EEG measurement to predict performance on the Weschler Intelligence test (WISC-R).
Methods
Resting eyes closed EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations with a linked ears reference from 442 subjects aged 5\textendash{}52 years. The Weschler Intelligence test was administered to the same subjects but not while the EEG was recorded. Subjects were divided into high IQ ($\geq$120) and low IQ ($\leq$90) groups. EEG variables at P$<$.05 were entered into a factor analysis and then the single highest loading variable on each factor was entered into a discriminant analysis where groups were high IQ vs. low.Q.
Results
Discriminant analysis of high vs. low IQ was 92.81\textendash{}97.14\% accurate. Discriminant scores of intermediate IQ subjects (i.e. 90$<$IQ$<$120) were intermediate between the high and low IQ groups. Linear regression predictions of IQ significantly correlated with the discriminant scores (r=0.818\textendash{}0.825, P$<$10-6). The ranking of effect size was EEG phase$>$EEG coherence$>$EEG amplitude asymmetry$>$absolute power$>$relative power and power ratios. The strongest correlations to IQ were short EEG phase delays in the frontal lobes and long phase delays in the posterior cortical regions, reduced coherence and increased absolute power.
Conclusions
The findings are consistent with increased neural efficiency and increased brain complexity as positively related to intelligence, and with frontal lobe synchronization of neural resources as a significant contributing factor to EEG and intelligence correlations.
Significance
Quantitative EEG predictions of intelligence provide medium to strong effect size estimates of cognitive functioning while simultaneously revealing a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological substrates of intelligence.},

Such a claim implies three observations: (1) Raven's has a remarkably high association with g; (2) Raven's does not share variance with a group-level factor; and (3) Raven's is associated with virtually no test specificity.

  abstract = {We re-examine the commonly held view that learning and memory necessarily require potentiation of synapses. A simple neuronal model of self-organized learning with no positive reinforcement is presented. The strongest synapses are selected for propagation of activity. Active synaptic connections are temporarily ``tagged'' and subsequently depressed if the resulting output turns out to be unsuccessful. Thus, all learning occurs by mistakes. The model operates at a highly adaptive state with low activity. Previously stored patterns may be swiftly retrieved when the environment and the demands of the brain change. The combined process of: (i) activity selection by extremal ``winner-take-all'' dynamics; and (ii) the subsequent weeding out of synapses may be viewed as synaptic Darwinism. We argue that all the features of the model are biologically plausible and discuss our results in light of recent experiments by Fitzsimonds et al. on back-propagation of long-term depression, by Xu et al. on facilitation of long-term depression in the hippocampus by behavioural stress, and by Frey and Morris on synaptic tagging.},

We examined functional connectivity between 82 regions, including graph theoretic properties of the overall network. Some previous findings were extended to the Portuguese-speaking population, specifically the presence of small-world organization of the brain and relationships of intelligence with connectivity of frontal, pre-central, parietal, occipital, fusiform and supramarginal gyrus and caudate nucleus.

  abstract = {Many kinds of complex systems exhibit characteristic patterns of temporal correlations that emerge as the result of functional interactions within a structured network. One such complex system is the brain, composed of numerous neuronal units linked by synaptic connections. The activity of these neuronal units gives rise to dynamic states that are characterized by specific patterns of neuronal activation and co-activation. These patterns, called functional connectivity, are possible neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes. Which functional connectivity patterns arise depends on the anatomical structure of the underlying network, which in turn is modified by a broad range of activity-dependent processes. Given this intricate relationship between structure and function, the question of how patterns of anatomical connectivity constrain or determine dynamical patterns is of considerable theoretical importance. The present study develops computational tools to analyze networks in terms of their structure and dynamics. We identify different classes of network, including networks that are characterized by high complexity. These highly complex networks have distinct structural characteristics such as clustered connectivity and short wiring length similar to those of large-scale networks of the cerebral cortex. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Although schizophrenia was previously associated with affected spatial neuronal synchronization, surprisingly little is known about the temporal dynamics of neuronal oscillations in this disease. However, given that the coordination of neuronal processes in time represents an essential aspect of practically all cognitive operations, it might be strongly affected in patients with schizophrenia. In the present study we aimed at quantifying long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in patients (18 with schizophrenia; 3 with schizoaffective disorder) and 28 healthy control subjects matched for age and gender. Ongoing neuronal oscillations were recorded with multi-channel EEG at rest condition. LRTC in the range 5\textendash{}50s were analyzed with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. The amplitude of neuronal oscillations in alpha and beta frequency ranges did not differ between patients and control subjects. However, LRTC were strongly attenuated in patients with schizophrenia in both alpha and beta frequency ranges. Moreover, the cross-frequency correlation between LRTC belonging to alpha and beta oscillations was stronger for patients than healthy controls, indicating that similar neurophysiological processes affect neuronal dynamics in both frequency ranges. We believe that the attenuation of LRTC is most likely due to the increased variability in neuronal activity, which was previously hypothesized to underlie an excessive switching between the neuronal states in patients with schizophrenia. Attenuated LRTC might allow for more random associations between neuronal activations, which in turn might relate to the occurrence of thought disorders in schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging has revealed robust large-scale patterns of high neuronal activity in the human brain in the classical eyes-closed wakeful rest condition, pointing to the presence of a baseline of sustained endogenous processing in the absence of stimulus-driven neuronal activity. This baseline state has been shown to differ in major depressive disorder. More recently, several studies have documented that despite having a complex temporal structure, baseline oscillatory activity is characterized by persistent autocorrelations for tens of seconds that are highly replicable within and across subjects. The functional significance of these long-range temporal correlations has remained unknown.
We recorded neuromagnetic activity in patients with a major depressive disorder and in healthy control subjects during eyes-closed wakeful rest and quantified the long-range temporal correlations in the amplitude fluctuations of different frequency bands. We found that temporal correlations in the theta-frequency band (3-7 Hz) were almost absent in the 5-100 s time range in the patients but prominent in the control subjects. The magnitude of temporal correlations over the left temporocentral region predicted the severity of depression in the patients.
These data indicate that long-range temporal correlations in theta oscillations are a salient characteristic of the healthy human brain and may have diagnostic potential in psychiatric disorders. We propose a link between the abnormal temporal structure of theta oscillations in the depressive patients and the systems-level impairments of limbic-cortical networks that have been identified in recent anatomical and functional studies of patients with major depressive disorder.},

However, most previous studies have focused on graph metrics of stationary brain graphs, ignoring that brain connectivity exhibits fluctuations over time. Here we develop a new framework for accessing dynamic graph properties of time-varying functional brain connectivity in resting-state fMRI data and apply it to healthy controls (HCs) and patients with schizophrenia (SZs). Specifically, nodes of brain graphs are defined by intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) identified by group independent component analysis (ICA). Dynamic graph metrics of the time-varying brain connectivity estimated by the correlation of sliding time-windowed ICA time courses of ICNs are calculated. First- and second-level connectivity states are detected based on the correlation of nodal connectivity strength between time-varying brain graphs. Our results indicate that SZs show decreased variance in the dynamic graph metrics. Consistent with prior stationary functional brain connectivity works, graph measures of identified first-level connectivity states show lower values in SZs. In addition, more first-level connectivity states are disassociated with the second-level connectivity state which resembles the stationary connectivity pattern computed by the entire scan. Collectively, the findings provide new evidence about altered dynamic brain graphs in schizophrenia, which may underscore the abnormal brain performance in this mental illness.},

  abstract = {Intelligence is a core construct in differential psychology and behavioural genetics, and should be so in cognitive neuroscience. It is one of the best predictors of important life outcomes such as education, occupation, mental and physical health and illness, and mortality. Intelligence is one of the most heritable behavioural traits. Here, we highlight five genetic findings that are special to intelligence differences and that have important implications for its genetic architecture and for gene-hunting expeditions. (i) The heritability of intelligence increases from about 20\% in infancy to perhaps 80\% in later adulthood. (ii) Intelligence captures genetic effects on diverse cognitive and learning abilities, which correlate phenotypically about 0.30 on average but correlate genetically about 0.60 or higher. (iii) Assortative mating is greater for intelligence (spouse correlations \textasciitilde{}0.40) than for other behavioural traits such as personality and psychopathology (\textasciitilde{}0.10) or physical traits such as height and weight (\textasciitilde{}0.20). Assortative mating pumps additive genetic variance into the population every generation, contributing to the high narrow heritability (additive genetic variance) of intelligence. (iv) Unlike psychiatric disorders, intelligence is normally distributed with a positive end of exceptional performance that is a model for `positive genetics'. (v) Intelligence is associated with education and social class and broadens the causal perspectives on how these three inter-correlated variables contribute to social mobility, and health, illness and mortality differences. These five findings arose primarily from twin studies. They are being confirmed by the first new quantitative genetic technique in a century\textemdash{}Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA)\textemdash{}which estimates genetic influence using genome-wide genotypes in large samples of unrelated individuals. Comparing GCTA results to the results of twin studies reveals important insights into the genetic architecture of intelligence that are relevant to attempts to narrow the `missing heritability' gap.},

This review examines these principles as applied to the organization, development and function of complex brain networks. Specifically, we examine the structural properties of large-scale anatomical and functional brain networks and discuss how they might arise in the course of network growth and rewiring. Moreover, we examine the relationship between the structural substrate of neuroanatomy and more dynamic functional and effective connectivity patterns that underlie human cognition. We suggest that network analysis offers new fundamental insights into global and integrative aspects of brain function, including the origin of flexible and coherent cognitive states within the neural architecture.},

  abstract = {Individual variation in structural brain network topology has been associated with heritable behavioral phenotypes such as intelligence and schizophrenia, making it a candidate endophenotype. However, little is known about the genetic influences on individual variation in structural brain network topology. Moreover, the extent to which structural brain network topology overlaps with heritability for integrity and volume of white matter remains unknown. In this study, structural network topology was examined using diffusion tensor imaging at 3T. Binary connections between 82 structurally defined brain regions per subject were traced, allowing for estimation of individual topological network properties. Heritability of normalized characteristic path length ($\lambda$), normalized clustering coefficient ($\gamma$), microstructural integrity (FA), and volume of the white matter were estimated using a twin design, including 156 adult twins from the newly acquired U-TWIN cohort. Both $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ were estimated to be under substantial genetic influence. The heritability of $\gamma$ was estimated to be 68\%, the heritability estimate for $\lambda$ was estimated to be 57\%. Genetic influences on network measures were found to be partly overlapping with volumetric and microstructural properties of white matter, but the largest component of genetic variance was unique to both network traits. Normalized clustering coefficient and normalized characteristic path length are substantially heritable, and influenced by independent genetic factors that are largely unique to network measures, but partly also implicated in white matter directionality and volume. Thus, network measures provide information about genetic influence on brain structure, independent of global white matter characteristics such as volume and microstructural directionality.

  abstract = {Ongoing neural dynamics comprise both frequency-specific oscillations and broadband-features, such as long-range dependence (LRD). Despite both being behaviorally relevant, little is known about their potential interactions. In humans, 8\textendash{}12 Hz $\alpha$ oscillations constitute the strongest deviation from 1/f power-law scaling, the signature of LRD. We postulated that $\alpha$ oscillations, believed to exert active inhibitory gating, downmodulate the temporal width of LRD in slower ongoing brain activity. In two independent ``resting-state'' datasets (electroencephalography surface recordings and magnetoencephalography source reconstructions), both across space and dynamically over time, power of $\alpha$ activity covaried with the power slope $<$5 Hz (i.e., greater $\alpha$ activity shortened LRD). Causality of $\alpha$ activity dynamics was implied by its temporal precedence over changes of slope. A model where power-law fluctuations of the $\alpha$ envelope inhibit baseline activity closely replicated our results. Thus, $\alpha$ oscillations may provide an active control mechanism to adaptively regulate LRD of brain activity at slow temporal scales, thereby shaping internal states and cognitive processes.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The two prominent features of ongoing brain activity are oscillations and temporal long-range dependence. Both shape behavioral performance, but little is known about their interaction. Here, we demonstrate such an interaction in EEG and MEG recordings of task-free human brain activity. Specifically, we show that spontaneous dynamics in alpha activity explain ensuing variations of dependence in the low and ultra-low-frequency range. In modeling, two features of alpha oscillations are critical to account for the observed effects on long-range dependence, scale-free properties of alpha oscillations themselves, and a modulation of baseline levels, presumably inhibitory. Both these properties have been observed empirically, and our study hence establishes alpha oscillations as a regulatory mechanism governing long-range dependence or ``memory'' in slow ongoing brain activity.},

Critically, global connectivity in this LPFC region, involving connections both within and outside the frontoparietal network, showed a highly selective relationship with individual differences in fluid intelligence.

We found that fluid intelligence level (gf) depends on the precise synchronization of fast oscillations to a specific time window of slow brain rhythms. Specifically, by examining EEG recordings of 50 people in resting state as well as during performance at two gf tasks we found converging evidence that high-gf participants display stronger Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) related to an increased concentration of gamma (\textasciitilde{}36Hz) spectral power at the descending phase of delta oscillations (\textasciitilde{}3Hz). Delta-gamma PAC strength explained 35\% variance in scores on multiple gf tests, outperforming six alternative EEG-based predictors including spectral power, complexity and amplitude-amplitude coupling.

We found frequency-specific colocalization of scale-free dynamics and FC so that the interareal couplings of LRTCs and the propagation of neuronal avalanches were most pronounced in the predominant pathways of FC. Several control analyses and the frequency specificity of network colocalization showed that the results were not trivial by-products of either brain dynamics or our analysis approach. Crucially, scale-free neuronal dynamics and connectivity also had colocalized modular structures at multiple levels of network organization, suggesting that modules of FC would be endowed with partially independent dynamic states.

We studied the task-dependency of this process in a combined visual search-change detection experiment. Participants viewed two (nearly) same displays in succession. First time they had to find and remember multiple targets among distractors, so the ongoing task involved memory encoding. Second time they had to determine if a target had changed in orientation, so the ongoing task involved memory retrieval. From multichannel EEG recorded during 200~ms intervals time-locked to fixation onsets, we estimated the functional connectivity using a weighted phase lag index at the frequencies of theta, alpha, and beta bands, and derived global and local measures of the functional connectivity graphs. We found differences between both memory task conditions for several network measures, such as mean path length, radius, diameter, closeness and eccentricity, mainly in the alpha band. Both the local and the global measures indicated that encoding involved a more segregated mode of operation than retrieval. These differences arose immediately after fixation onset and persisted for the entire duration of the lambda complex, an evoked potential commonly associated with early visual perception. We concluded that encoding and retrieval differentially shape network configurations involved in early visual perception, affecting the way the visual input is processed at each fixation. These findings demonstrate that task requirements dynamically control the functional connectivity networks involved in early visual perception.},

Everyday problem solving requires the ability to go beyond experience by efficiently encoding and manipulating new information, i.e., fluid intelligence (Gf) [1]. Performance in tasks involving Gf, such as logical and abstract reasoning, has been shown to rely on distributed neural networks, with a crucial role played by prefrontal regions [2]. Synchronization of neuronal activity in the gamma band is a ubiquitous phenomenon within the brain; however, no evidence of its causal involvement in cognition exists to date [3]. Here, we show an enhancement of Gf ability in a cognitive task induced by exogenous rhythmic stimulation within the gamma band. Imperceptible alternating current [4] delivered through the scalp over the left middle frontal gyrus resulted in a frequency-specific shortening of the time required to find the correct solution in a visuospatial abstract reasoning task classically employed to measure Gf abilities (i.e., Raven's matrices) [5]. Crucially, gamma-band stimulation ($\gamma$-tACS) selectively enhanced performance only on more complex trials involving conditional/logical reasoning. The present finding supports a direct involvement of gamma oscillatory activity in the mechanisms underlying higher-order human cognition.},

  abstract = {Scale-free fluctuations are ubiquitous in behavioral performance and neuronal activity. In time scales from seconds to hundreds of seconds, psychophysical dynamics and the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal oscillations are governed by power-law-form long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). In millisecond time scales, neuronal activity comprises cascade-like neuronal avalanches that exhibit power-law size and lifetime distributions. However, it remains unknown whether these neuronal scaling laws are correlated with those characterizing behavioral performance or whether neuronal LRTCs and avalanches are related. Here, we show that the neuronal scaling laws are strongly correlated both with each other and with behavioral scaling laws. We used source reconstructed magneto- and electroencephalographic recordings to characterize the dynamics of ongoing cortical activity. We found robust power-law scaling in neuronal LRTCs and avalanches in resting-state data and during the performance of audiovisual threshold stimulus detection tasks. The LRTC scaling exponents of the behavioral performance fluctuations were correlated with those of concurrent neuronal avalanches and LRTCs in anatomically identified brain systems. The behavioral exponents also were correlated with neuronal scaling laws derived from a resting-state condition and with a similar anatomical topography. Finally, despite the difference in time scales, the scaling exponents of neuronal LRTCs and avalanches were strongly correlated during both rest and task performance. Thus, long and short time-scale neuronal dynamics are related and functionally significant at the behavioral level. These data suggest that the temporal structures of human cognitive fluctuations and behavioral variability stem from the scaling laws of individual and intrinsic brain dynamics.},

At this point, they demonstrate complex patterning of fluctuations at all scales of space and time. Criticality is an attractive model for brain dynamics because it optimizes information transfer, storage capacity, and sensitivity to external stimuli in computational models. However, to date there has been little direct experimental evidence for critical dynamics of human brain networks. Here, we considered two measures of functional coupling or phase synchronization between components of a dynamic system: the phase lock interval or duration of synchronization between a specific pair of time series or processes in the system and the lability of global synchronization among all pairs of processes. We confirmed that both synchronization metrics demonstrated scale invariant behaviors in two computational models of critical dynamics as well as in human brain functional systems oscillating at low frequencies ($<$0.5 Hz, measured using functional MRI) and at higher frequencies (1\textendash{}125 Hz, measured using magnetoencephalography). We conclude that human brain functional networks demonstrate critical dynamics in all frequency intervals, a phenomenon we have described as broadband criticality.},

  abstract = {Higher brain functions depend upon the rapid creation and dissolution of ever changing synchronous cell assemblies. We examine the hypothesis that the dynamics of this process displays scale-free, self-similar properties. EEGs (19 channels, average reference, sample frequency 500 Hz) of 15 healthy subjects (10 men; mean age 22.5 years) were analyzed during eyes-closed and eyes-open no-task conditions. Mean level of synchronization as a function of time was estimated with the synchronization likelihood for five frequency bands (0.5\textendash{}4, 4\textendash{}8, 8\textendash{}13, 13\textendash{}30, and 30\textendash{}48 Hz). Scaling in these time series was investigated with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). DFA analysis of global synchronization time series showed scale-free characteristics, suggesting neuronal dynamics do not necessarily have a characteristic time constant. The scaling exponent as determined with DFA differed significantly for different frequency bands and conditions. The exponent was close to 1.5 for low frequencies ($\delta$, \texttheta, and $\alpha$) and close to 1 for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ bands. Eye opening decreased the exponent, in particular in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands. Fluctuations of EEG synchronization in $\delta$, \texttheta, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ bands exhibit scale-free dynamics in eyes-closed as well as eyes-open no-task states. The decrease in the scaling exponent following eye opening reflects a relative preponderance of rapid fluctuations with respect to slow changes in the mean synchronization level. The existence of scaling suggests that the underlying dynamics may display self-organized criticality, possibly representing a near-optimal state for information processing. Hum.

These spatiotemporal patterns, called resting state networks, display low-frequency characteristics ($<$0.1 Hz) observed typically in the BOLD-fMRI signal of human subjects. We aim here to understand the origins of resting state activity through modeling via a global spiking attractor network of the brain. This approach offers a realistic mechanistic model at the level of each single brain area based on spiking neurons and realistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. Integrating the biologically realistic diffusion tensor imaging/diffusion spectrum imaging-based neuroanatomical connectivity into the brain model, the resultant emerging resting state functional connectivity of the brain network fits quantitatively best the experimentally observed functional connectivity in humans when the brain network operates at the edge of instability. Under these conditions, the slow fluctuating ($<$0.1 Hz) resting state networks emerge as structured noise fluctuations around a stable low firing activity equilibrium state in the presence of latent ``ghost'' multistable attractors. The multistable attractor landscape defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity.},

TMS allows researchers and clinicians to directly stimulate cortical regions accessible to electromagnetic coils positioned on the scalp. The induced activation can then propagate through long-range connections to other brain areas. Thus, by identifying distal regions activated during TMS, researchers can infer connectivity patterns in the healthy human brain and can examine how those patterns may be disrupted in patients with different brain disorders. Conversely, connectivity maps derived using neuroimaging methods can identify components of a dysfunctional network. Nodes in this dysfunctional network accessible as targets for TMS by virtue of their proximity to the scalp may then permit TMS-induced alterations of components of the network not directly accessible to TMS via propagated effects. Thus TMS can provide a portal for accessing and altering neural dynamics in networks that are widely distributed anatomically. Finally, when long-term modulation of network dynamics is induced by trains of repetitive TMS, changes in functional connectivity patterns can be studied in parallel with changes in patient symptoms. These correlational data can elucidate neural mechanisms underlying illness and recovery. In this review, we focus on the application of these approaches to the study of psychiatric and neurological illnesses.},

A 1/f-like power spectrum is indicative of arrhythmic brain activity that does not contain a predominant temporal scale (hence, ``scale-free''). This characteristic of scale-free brain activity distinguishes it from brain oscillations. While scale-free brain activity and brain oscillations coexist, our understanding of the former remains very limited. Recent research has shed light on the spatiotemporal organization, functional significance and potential generative mechanisms of scale-free brain activity, as well as its developmental and clinical relevance. A deeper understanding of this prevalent brain signal should provide new insights and analytical tools for cognitive neuroscience.},

Traditionally associated with sensorimotor functions, beta oscillations have recently become more broadly implicated in top-down processing, long-range communication, and preservation of the current brain state. Here, we extend and refine these views based on accumulating new findings of content-specific beta-synchronization during endogenous information processing in working memory (WM) and decision making. We characterize such content-specific beta activity as short-lived, flexible network dynamics supporting the endogenous (re)activation of cortical representations. Specifically, we suggest that beta-mediated ensemble formation within and between cortical areas may awake, rather than merely preserve, an endogenous cognitive set in the service of current task demands. This proposal accommodates key aspects of content-specific beta modulations in monkeys and humans, integrates with timely computational models, and outlines a functional role for beta that fits its transient temporal characteristics.},

However, the exact relationship between functional and structural components of brain plasticity/connectivity phenomena is still unclear and its explanation is a major challenge within modern neuroscience. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with or without electroencephalography (EEG), is a sensitive and objective measure of the effect of different kinds of noninvasive manipulation of the brain's activity, particularly of the motor cortex. Moreover, the key feature of TMS and TMS-EEG coregistration is their crucial role in tracking temporal dynamics and inner hierarchies of brain functional and effective connectivities, possibly clarifying some essential issues underlying brain plasticity. All together, the findings presented here are significant for the adoption of the TMS and TMS-EEG coregistration techniques as a tool for basic neurophysiologic research and, in the future, even for clinical diagnostics purposes.},

Specifically, anodal tDCS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) together with cathodal tDCS of the supraorbital region have been associated with improvement of cognition and mood, and have been suggested for the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although modeled mathematically, the distribution, direction, and extent of tDCS-mediated effects on brain physiology are not well understood. The current study investigates whether tDCS of the human prefrontal cortex modulates resting-state network (RSN) connectivity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirteen healthy subjects underwent real and sham tDCS in random order on separate days. tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA with the anode positioned over the left DLPFC and the cathode over the right supraorbital region. Patterns of resting-state brain connectivity were assessed before and after tDCS with 3 T fMRI, and changes were analyzed for relevant networks related to the stimulation\textendash{}electrode localizations. At baseline, four RSNs were detected, corresponding to the default mode network (DMN), the left and right frontal-parietal networks (FPNs) and the self-referential network. After real tDCS and compared with sham tDCS, significant changes of regional brain connectivity were found for the DMN and the FPNs both close to the primary stimulation site and in connected brain regions. These findings show that prefrontal tDCS modulates resting-state functional connectivity in distinct functional networks of the human brain.},

  abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique capable of modulating cortical excitability and thereby influencing behavior and learning. Recent evidence suggests that bilateral tDCS over both primary sensorimotor cortices (SM1) yields more prominent effects on motor performance in both healthy subjects and chronic stroke patients than unilateral tDCS over SM1. To better characterize the underlying neural mechanisms of this effect, we aimed to explore changes in resting-state functional connectivity during both stimulation types. In a randomized single-blind crossover design, 12 healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest before, during, and after 20 min of unilateral, bilateral, and sham tDCS stimulation over SM1. Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) was used to investigate tDCS-induced changes in functional connectivity patterns across the whole brain. Uni- and bilateral tDCS over SM1 resulted in functional connectivity changes in widespread brain areas compared with sham stimulation both during and after stimulation. Whereas bilateral tDCS predominantly modulated changes in primary and secondary motor as well as prefrontal regions, unilateral tDCS affected prefrontal, parietal, and cerebellar areas. No direct effect was seen under the stimulating electrode in the unilateral condition. The time course of changes in functional connectivity in the respective brain areas was nonlinear and temporally dispersed. These findings provide evidence toward a network-based understanding regarding the underpinnings of specific tDCS interventions.},

Previous studies have suggested that the magnitude of neural variability affects behavior such that perceptual performance is better on trials and in individuals where variability quenching is larger. To what degree are neural variability magnitudes of individual subjects flexible or static? Here, we used EEG recordings from adult humans to demonstrate that neural variability magnitudes in visual cortex are remarkably consistent across different tasks and recording sessions. While magnitudes of neural variability differed dramatically across individual subjects, they were surprisingly stable across four tasks with different stimuli, temporal structures, and attentional/cognitive demands as well as across experimental sessions separated by one year. These experiments reveal that, in adults, neural variability magnitudes are mostly solidified individual characteristics that change little with task or time, and are likely to predispose individual subjects to exhibit distinct behavioral capabilities.},

EEG was recorded in 91 normal subjects (age 20\textendash{}65 years) in a resting condition. The amplitude of ongoing $\alpha$ and $\beta$ oscillations was extracted with band-pass filtering and Hilbert transform, and long-range temporal correlations were analyzed with detrended fluctuation analysis. The topography of long-range temporal correlations was comparable for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ oscillations, showing largest scaling exponents in the occipital and parietal areas. This topography was partially similar to that of the power distribution and a weak positive correlation was observed between long-range temporal correlations and power of neuronal oscillations. Long-range temporal correlations were stronger in $\alpha$ than $\beta$ oscillations, but only in a few electrode locations in the left hemisphere. In both frequency bands long-range temporal correlations were stronger in males than in females and were largely unaffected by the age of the subjects. It is hypothesized that the idling state of the occipital areas in the closed-eyes condition may explain both large power values and pronounced long-range temporal correlations in this region.},

Brain structure (the pattern of neuroanatomical connections) is thought to strongly influence and constrain brain function (the pattern of neuronal activations). Concurrently, brain function is thought to gradually reshape brain structure, through processes such as activity-dependent plasticity (the ``what fires together, wires together'' principle). In this study, we examined the relationship between brain structure and function in a biologically realistic mathematical model. More specifically, we considered the relationship between realistic features of brain structure, such as self-similar organization of specialized brain regions at multiple spatial scales (hierarchical modularity) and realistic features of brain activity, such as self-similar complex dynamics poised between order and randomness (self-organized criticality). We found a direct association between these structural and functional features in our model. This association only occurred in the presence of activity-dependent plasticity, and may reflect the importance of the corresponding structural and functional features in neuronal information processing.},

  abstract = {New work suggests that blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability can be a much more powerful index of human age than mean activation, and that older brains are actually less variable than younger brains. However, little is known of how BOLD variability and task performance may relate. In the current study, we examined BOLD variability in relation to age, and reaction time speed and consistency in healthy younger (20\textendash{}30 years) and older (56\textendash{}85 years) adults on three cognitive tasks (perceptual matching, attentional cueing, and delayed match-to-sample). Results indicated that younger, faster, and more consistent performers exhibited significantly higher brain variability across tasks, and showed greater variability-based regional differentiation compared with older, poorer-performing adults. Also, when we compared brain variability- and typical mean-based effects, the respective spatial patterns were essentially orthogonal across brain measures, and any regions that did overlap were largely opposite in directionality of effect. These findings help establish the functional basis of BOLD variability, and further support the statistical and spatial differentiation between BOLD variability and BOLD mean. We thus argue that the precise nature of relations between aging, cognition, and brain function is underappreciated by using mean-based brain measures exclusively.},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques have contributed significantly to our understanding of brain function. Current methods are based on the analysis of gradual and continuous changes in the brain blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal. Departing from that approach, recent work has shown that equivalent results can be obtained by inspecting only the relatively large amplitude BOLD signal peaks, suggesting that relevant information can be condensed in discrete events. This idea is further explored here to demonstrate how brain dynamics at resting state can be captured just by the timing and location of such events, i.e., in terms of a spatiotemporal point process. The method allows, for the first time, to define a theoretical framework in terms of an order and control parameter derived from fMRI data, where the dynamical regime can be interpreted as one corresponding to a system close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that the resting brain spends most of the time near the critical point of such transition and exhibits avalanches of activity ruled by the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal events at smaller scales. Given the demonstrated functional relevance of the resting state brain dynamics, its representation as a discrete process might facilitate large-scale analysis of brain function both in health and disease.},

While most early studies confirmed this hypothesis later research has revealed contradictory evidence or has identified some moderating variables like sex, task type, task complexity or brain area. Neuroscientific training studies suggest that neural efficiency also seems to be a function of the amount and quality of learning. From integrating this evidence we conclude that neural efficiency might arise when individuals are confronted with tasks of (subjectively) low to moderate task difficulty and it is mainly observable for frontal brain areas. This is true for easier novel cognitive tasks or after sufficient practice allowing participants to develop appropriate (efficient) strategies to deal with the task. In very complex tasks more able individuals seem to invest more cortical resources resulting in positive correlations between brain usage and cognitive ability. Based on the reviewed evidence we propose future empirical approaches in this field.},

  abstract = {Self-organized criticality refers to the spontaneous emergence of self-similar dynamics in complex systems poised between order and randomness. The presence of self-organized critical dynamics in the brain is theoretically appealing and is supported by recent neurophysiological studies. Despite this, the neurobiological determinants of these dynamics have not been previously sought. Here, we systematically examined the influence of such determinants in hierarchically modular networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity and axonal conduction delays. We characterized emergent dynamics in our networks by distributions of active neuronal ensemble modules (neuronal avalanches) and rigorously assessed these distributions for power-law scaling. We found that spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity enabled a rapid phase transition from random subcritical dynamics to ordered supercritical dynamics. Importantly, modular connectivity and low wiring cost broadened this transition, and enabled a regime indicative of self-organized criticality. The regime only occurred when modular connectivity, low wiring cost and synaptic plasticity were simultaneously present, and the regime was most evident when between-module connection density scaled as a power-law. The regime was robust to variations in other neurobiologically relevant parameters and favored systems with low external drive and strong internal interactions. Increases in system size and connectivity facilitated internal interactions, permitting reductions in external drive and facilitating convergence of postsynaptic-response magnitude and synaptic-plasticity learning rate parameter values towards neurobiologically realistic levels. We hence infer a novel association between self-organized critical neuronal dynamics and several neurobiologically realistic features of structural connectivity. The central role of these features in our model may reflect their importance for neuronal information processing., The intricate relationship between structural brain connectivity and functional brain activity is an important and intriguing research area. Brain structure (the pattern of neuroanatomical connections) is thought to strongly influence and constrain brain function (the pattern of neuronal activations). Concurrently, brain function is thought to gradually reshape brain structure, through processes such as activity-dependent plasticity (the ``what fires together, wires together'' principle). In this study, we examined the relationship between brain structure and function in a biologically realistic mathematical model. More specifically, we considered the relationship between realistic features of brain structure, such as self-similar organization of specialized brain regions at multiple spatial scales (hierarchical modularity) and realistic features of brain activity, such as self-similar complex dynamics poised between order and randomness (self-organized criticality). We found a direct association between these structural and functional features in our model. This association only occurred in the presence of activity-dependent plasticity, and may reflect the importance of the corresponding structural and functional features in neuronal information processing.},

  doi = {10.1111/ejn.13767},
  abstract = {Neuronal oscillations and their inter-areal synchronization may be instrumental in regulating neuronal communication in distributed networks. Several lines of research have, however, shown that cognitive tasks engage neuronal oscillations simultaneously in multiple frequency bands that have distinct functional roles in cognitive processing. Gamma oscillations (30-120~Hz) are associated with bottom-up processing, while slower oscillations in delta (1-4~Hz), theta (4-7~Hz), alpha (8-14~Hz) and beta (14-30~Hz) frequency bands may have roles in executive or top-down controlling functions, although also other distinctions have been made. Identification of the mechanisms that integrate such spectrally distributed processing and govern neuronal communication among these networks is crucial for understanding how cognitive functions are achieved in neuronal circuits. Cross-frequency interactions among oscillations have been recognized as a likely candidate mechanism for such integration. We advance here the hypothesis that phase-phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations in two different frequency bands, cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS), could serve to integrate, coordinate and regulate neuronal processing distributed into neuronal assemblies concurrently in multiple frequency bands. A trail of studies over the past decade has revealed the presence of CFS among cortical oscillations and linked CFS with roles in cognitive integration. We propose that CFS could connect fast and slow oscillatory networks and thereby integrate distributed cognitive functions such as representation of sensory information with attentional and executive functions.},

This study aimed to characterize functional connectivity in the healthy human newborn, and to identify the changes in connectivity related to vigilance states and to maturation during the early postnatal weeks. We recorded active and quiet sleep of 38 sleeping newborn babies using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) at 2 neonatal time points. Functional connectivity between brain areas was quantified with 3 different metrics: phase-phase correlations, amplitude-amplitude correlations (AACs), and phase-amplitude correlations. All functional connectivity measures changed significantly between vigilance states and matured rapidly after normal birth. The observed changes were frequency-specific, most salient in AAC coupling, and their development was compatible with the known development of structural cortico-cortical connectivity. The present findings support the view that emerging functional connectivity exhibits fundamental differences between sleep states months before the onset of genuine EEG signatures of sleep states. Moreover, our findings also support the idea that early cortical events entail different mechanisms of functional coupling needed to provide endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.},

Importantly, while high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC may thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

Here, we extend and refine these views based on accumulating new findings of content-specific beta-synchronization during endogenous information processing in working memory (WM) and decision making. We characterize such content-specific beta activity as short-lived, flexible network dynamics supporting the endogenous (re)activation of cortical representations. Specifically, we suggest that beta-mediated ensemble formation within and between cortical areas may awake, rather than merely preserve, an endogenous cognitive set in the service of current task demands. This proposal accommodates key aspects of content-specific beta modulations in monkeys and humans, integrates with timely computational models, and outlines a functional role for beta that fits its transient temporal characteristics.},

Methods: Twelve normal subjects were measured two times with a test\textendash{}retest interval of several days. Open- and closed-eyes conditions were used, representing different levels of arousal. The amplitude of the alpha and beta oscillations was extracted with bandpass filtering and the Hilbert transform. The long-range temporal correlations were quantified with detrended fluctuation analysis. Results: The amplitude dynamics of the alpha and beta oscillations demonstrated power-law long-range temporal correlations lasting for tens of seconds. These correlations were degraded in the open- compared to the closed-eyes condition. Test\textendash{}retest statistics demonstrated that the long-range temporal correlations had significant reliability, which was greatest in the closed-eyes condition. Conclusions: The presence of long-range temporal correlations indicates that the amplitude of neuronal oscillations at a given time is dependent on the amplitude at times as remote in the past as tens of seconds. The reliability of long-range temporal correlations suggests that the mechanisms generating the amplitude fluctuations are not perturbed over several days. The systematic changes in the scaling exponents at different levels of arousal indicate that these changes occur on many time scales (5\textendash{}80 s) as a result of modifications in the intrinsic dynamics of the neuronal oscillations. Significance: This study demonstrates that the dynamics of spontaneous neuronal oscillations possess long-range temporal correlations with properties suitable for functional and clinical studies.},

Coupling can take different forms as it associates the phase, frequency and/or amplitude of coupled oscillations. These specific forms of coupling are a signature for the underlying network physiology and probably relate to distinct cognitive functions. Here I discuss three caveats in data analysis that can lead to mistake one specific form of cross-frequency coupling for another: 1, bicoherence assesses the level of phase-amplitude and not of phase-phase coupling as commonly accepted; 2, a test for phase-amplitude coupling can indeed signal phase-frequency coupling when the higher frequency signal is extracted using a too narrow band; 3, An oscillation whose frequency fluctuates may induce spurious amplitude anticorrelations between neighbouring frequency bands. I indicate practical rules to avoid such misidentifications and correctly identify the specific nature of cross-frequency coupled signals.},

While previous research has attempted to localise intelligence in circumscribed brain regions, more recent work focuses on functional interactions between regions. However, even though brain networks are characterised by substantial modularity, it is unclear whether and how the brain's modular organisation is associated with general intelligence. Modelling subject-specific brain~network graphs from functional MRI resting-state data (N\,=\,309), we found that intelligence was not associated with global modularity features (e.g., number or size of modules) or the whole-brain proportions of different node types (e.g., connector hubs or provincial hubs). In contrast, we observed characteristic associations between intelligence and node-specific measures of within- and between-module connectivity, particularly in frontal and parietal brain regions that have previously been linked to intelligence. We propose that the connectivity profile of these regions may shape intelligence-relevant aspects of information processing. Our data demonstrate that not only region-specific differences in brain structure and function, but also the network-topological embedding of fronto-parietal as well as other cortical and subcortical brain regions is related to individual differences in higher cognitive abilities, i.e., intelligence.},

  shorttitle = {Phase {{Locking Value}} Revisited},
  abstract = {When the concept of functional connectivity was first introduced in 1994, the study of brain synchronization seemed to be an unachievable goal. Yet, the advances in computer science and the increase in calculation power have allowed for the application of connectivity metrics to brain activity, first in sensor level and, over the last years, in source space. However, the study of source space synchronization is still a tedious task, as the high computational cost of the algorithm escalates with the square of the number of signals evaluated. In this work, we take the original implementation of Phase Locking Value (PLV) and re-formulate it in a highly computational efficient way. This new implementation avoids some highly CPU-expensive operations, achieving a 100-fold speedup over the original algorithm. This speedup makes possible to calculate whole-brain connectivity in source space in reasonable times. In addition, this reformulation presents a strong symmetry with coherence, which allows the direct comparison of both metrics. In our simulations, both metrics have a similar behavior. Nonetheless, PLV proves best to evaluate oscillators over a band, whereas coherence shows similar behavior when the synchronization occurs at only one frequency. We used this symmetry to introduce two new derived metrics insensitive to zero lag synchronization, the imaginary part of PLV (iPLV) and corrected imaginary part of PLV (ciPLV). Our simulations prove that these metrics, especially ciPLV, are highly robust in the presence of volume conduction. ciPLV, in particular, proves capable of ignoring zero-lag connectivity, while correctly estimating nonzero-lag connectivity. These results suggest that this metric is ideal to measure synchronization in the presence of volume conduction.},

Inter-subject variability of global PLI was low to moderate over frequency bands (0.12$<$CoV$<$0.28), higher for wPLI (0.25$<$CoV$<$0.55) and very low for gamma, lambda and SWI (CoV$<$0.048). TRT was good to excellent for global PLI/wPLI (0.68$<$ICC$<$0.80), regional PLI/wPLI (0.58$<$ICC$<$0.77), and fair to good for graph measures (0.32$<$ICC$<$0.73) except wPLI-based lambda in alpha1 (ICC = 0.12). Inter-electrode distance correlated very weakly with inter-electrode PLI (-0.06$<$rho$<$0) and weakly with inter-electrode wPLI (-0.22$<$rho$<$-0.18). Global PLI/wPLI and topographic connectivity patterns differed between frequency bands, and all individual networks showed a small-world-configuration. PLI/wPLI based network characterization derived from high-resolution EEG has apparently good reliability, which is one important requirement for longitudinal studies exploring the effects of chronic brain diseases over several years.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) may serve a functional role in neuronal computation, communication, and learning. In particular, the strength of phase-amplitude CFC differs across brain areas in a task-relevant manner, changes quickly in response to sensory, motor, and cognitive events, and correlates with performance in learning tasks. Importantly, while high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC may thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

  abstract = {Using EEG to elucidate the spontaneous activation of brain resting state networks is non trivial as the signal of interest is of low amplitude and it is difficult to distinguish the underlying neural sources. Using the principles of electric field topographical analysis, it is possible to estimate the meta-stable states of the brain (i.e., the resting state topographies, so-called microstates). We estimated seven resting state topographies explaining the EEG dataset with k-means clustering (N=164, 256 electrodes). Using a method specifically designed to localize the sources of broadband EEG scalp topographies by matching sensor and source space temporal patterns, we demonstrated that we can estimate the EEG resting state networks reliably by measuring the reproducibility of our findings. After subtracting their mean from the seven EEG resting state networks, we identified seven state-specific networks. The mean map includes regions known to be densely anatomically and functionally connected (superior frontal, superior parietal, insula, and anterior cingulate cortices). While the mean map can be interpreted as a ``router'', cross-linking multiple functional networks, the seven state-specific resting state networks partly resemble and extend previous fMRI-based networks estimated as the hemodynamic correlates of four canonical EEG microstates.},

  abstract = {Brain regions simultaneously activated during any cognitive process are functionally connected, forming large-scale networks. These functional networks can be examined during active conditions [i.e., task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)] and also in passive states (resting-fMRI), where the default mode network (DMN) is the most widely investigated system. The role of the DMN remains unclear, although it is known to be responsible for the shift between resting and focused attention processing. There is also some evidence for its malleability in relation to previous experience. Here we investigated brain connectivity patterns in 16 healthy young subjects by using an n-back task with increasing levels of memory load within the fMRI context. Prior to this working memory (WM) task, participants were trained outside fMRI with a shortened test version. Immediately after, they underwent a resting-state fMRI acquisition followed by the full fMRI n-back test. We observed that the degree of intrinsic correlation within DMN and WM networks was maximal during the most demanding n-back condition (3-back). Furthermore, individuals showing a stronger negative correlation between the two networks under both conditions exhibited better behavioural performance. Interestingly, and despite the fact that we considered eight different resting-state fMRI networks previously identified in humans, only the connectivity within the posteromedial parts of the DMN (precuneus) prior to the fMRI n-back task predicted WM execution. Our results using a data-driven probabilistic approach for fMRI analysis provide the first evidence of a direct relationship between behavioural performance and the degree of negative correlation between the DMN and WM networks. They further suggest that in the context of expectancy for an imminent cognitive challenge, higher resting-state activity in the posteromedial parietal cortex may be related to increased attentional preparatory resources.},

Traditionally, the structure of complex networks has been studied through their statistical properties and metrics concerned with node and link properties, e.g. degree-distribution, node centrality and modularity. Here, we study the characteristics of functional brain networks at the mesoscopic level from a novel perspective that highlights the role of inhomogeneities in the fabric of functional connections. This can be done by focusing on the features of a set of topological objects\textemdash{}homological cycles\textemdash{}associated with the weighted functional network. We leverage the detected topological information to define the homological scaffolds, a new set of objects designed to represent compactly the homological features of the correlation network and simultaneously make their homological properties amenable to networks theoretical methods. As a proof of principle, we apply these tools to compare resting-state functional brain activity in 15 healthy volunteers after intravenous infusion of placebo and psilocybin\textemdash{}the main psychoactive component of magic mushrooms. The results show that the homological structure of the brain's functional patterns undergoes a dramatic change post-psilocybin, characterized by the appearance of many transient structures of low stability and of a small number of persistent ones that are not observed in the case of placebo.},

This work sheds light on the future development of software citation standards, especially given the present landscape of conflicting citation practices.

  abstract = {We present two classes of improved estimators for mutual information M(X,Y), from samples of random points distributed according to some joint probability density $\mu$(x,y). In contrast to conventional estimators based on binnings, they are based on entropy estimates from k-nearest neighbor distances. This means that they are data efficient (with k=1 we resolve structures down to the smallest possible scales), adaptive (the resolution is higher where data are more numerous), and have minimal bias. Indeed, the bias of the underlying entropy estimates is mainly due to nonuniformity of the density at the smallest resolved scale, giving typically systematic errors which scale as functions of k$\slash$N for N points. Numerically, we find that both families become exact for independent distributions, i.e. the estimator ˆM(X,Y) vanishes (up to statistical fluctuations) if $\mu$(x,y)=$\mu$(x)$\mu$(y). This holds for all tested marginal distributions and for all dimensions of x and y. In addition, we give estimators for redundancies between more than two random variables. We compare our algorithms in detail with existing algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our estimators for assessing the actual independence of components obtained from independent component analysis (ICA), for improving ICA, and for estimating the reliability of blind source separation., This article appears in the following collection:},

We aimed to investigate the association between COMT rs4633 and verbal intelligence and the underlying neural mechanisms in Chinese Han healthy young adults. In 256 Chinese Han healthy young adults, we explored the modulatory effects of COMT rs4633 on verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and functional connectivity density (FCD) of the brain and the mediation effect of FCD on the association between COMT and VIQ. We further investigated the association between the expression patterns of dopamine receptor genes and the effect of COMT on FCD in the human brain. COMT rs4633 TT homozygotes exhibited lower VIQ than CC homozygotes and TC heterozygotes, higher long-range FCD (lrFCD) than CC homozygotes and TC heterozygotes in the left superior frontal gyrus. TT homozygotes and TC heterozygotes showed higher lrFCD than CC homozygotes in the left inferior parietal lobule. The lrFCD differences across genotypic subgroups were negatively associated with the expression of DRD2 and DRD3 genes. The left parietal lrFCD mediated the association between COMT rs4633 and VIQ. These findings provide a biological pathway that COMT rs4633 affects verbal intelligence via modulating the lrFCD of the left inferior parietal lobule.},

  abstract = {One hallmark example of a link between global topological network properties of complex functional brain connectivity and cognitive performance is the finding that general intelligence may depend on the efficiency of the brain's intrinsic functional network architecture. However, although this association has been featured prominently over the course of the last decade, the empirical basis for this broad association of general intelligence and global functional network efficiency is quite limited. In the current study, we set out to replicate the previously reported association between general intelligence and global functional network efficiency using the large sample size and high quality data of the Human Connectome Project, and extended the original study by testing for separate association of crystallized and fluid intelligence with global efficiency, characteristic path length, and global clustering coefficient. We were unable to provide evidence for the proposed association between general intelligence and functional brain network efficiency, as was demonstrated by van den Heuvel et~al. (2009), or for any other association with the global network measures employed. More specifically, across multiple network definition schemes, ranging from voxel-level networks to networks of only 100 nodes, no robust associations and only very weak non-significant effects with a maximal R2 of 0.01 could be observed. Notably, the strongest (non-significant) effects were observed in voxel-level networks.

  abstract = {We re-examine the commonly held view that learning and memory necessarily require potentiation of synapses. A simple neuronal model of self-organized learning with no positive reinforcement is presented. The strongest synapses are selected for propagation of activity. Active synaptic connections are temporarily ``tagged'' and subsequently depressed if the resulting output turns out to be unsuccessful. Thus, all learning occurs by mistakes. The model operates at a highly adaptive state with low activity. Previously stored patterns may be swiftly retrieved when the environment and the demands of the brain change. The combined process of: (i) activity selection by extremal ``winner-take-all'' dynamics; and (ii) the subsequent weeding out of synapses may be viewed as synaptic Darwinism. We argue that all the features of the model are biologically plausible and discuss our results in light of recent experiments by Fitzsimonds et al. on back-propagation of long-term depression, by Xu et al. on facilitation of long-term depression in the hippocampus by behavioural stress, and by Frey and Morris on synaptic tagging.},

  abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

These spatiotemporal patterns, called resting state networks, display low-frequency characteristics ($<$0.1 Hz) observed typically in the BOLD-fMRI signal of human subjects. We aim here to understand the origins of resting state activity through modeling via a global spiking attractor network of the brain. This approach offers a realistic mechanistic model at the level of each single brain area based on spiking neurons and realistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. Integrating the biologically realistic diffusion tensor imaging/diffusion spectrum imaging-based neuroanatomical connectivity into the brain model, the resultant emerging resting state functional connectivity of the brain network fits quantitatively best the experimentally observed functional connectivity in humans when the brain network operates at the edge of instability. Under these conditions, the slow fluctuating ($<$0.1 Hz) resting state networks emerge as structured noise fluctuations around a stable low firing activity equilibrium state in the presence of latent ``ghost'' multistable attractors. The multistable attractor landscape defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity.},

On another occasion, the subjects were administered the Intelligence Structure Test (IST). Both total IST score and some individual subtests of specific abilities showed significant positive correlations with EEG coherence in the theta band and significant negative relationships with EEG dimension, a measure of complexity and unpredictability of neural oscillatory dynamics underlying the EEG time series. Furthermore, EEG coherence and dimensional complexity were inversely related. Taken together, these EEG metrics accounted for over 30\% of the variability of the total IST score in this sample. No significant effects of the task type (spatial vs. verbal) or specific abilities were observed. Long-distance theta coherence between frontal and parieto-occipital areas showed the most consistent relationship with cognitive abilities. The results suggest that order to chaos ratio in task-related brain dynamics may be one of the biological factors underlying individual differences in cognitive abilities in adolescents.},

It has been hypothesized that the brain works to minimize the resources allocated towards higher cognitive functioning. Thus, for the intelligent brain it may be that not simply more is better, but rather more efficient is better. Energy metabolism supports both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission processes. Indeed, in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, the primary energetic costs are associated with neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that minimizing resources through the excitation- inhibition balance encompassing GABA and glutamate may be beneficial to general cognitive functioning using 7T 1H-MRS in 23 healthy individuals (male/female=16/7, 27.7$\pm$5.3 years). We find that a higher working memory index is significantly correlated with a lower GABA to glutamate ratio in the frontal cortex and with a lower glutamate level in the occipital cortex. Thus, it seems that working memory performance is associated with the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain.},

  abstract = {Human intelligence comprises comprehension of and reasoning about an infinitely variable external environment. A brain capable of large variability in neural configurations, or states, will more easily understand and predict variable external events. Entropy measures the variety of configurations possible within a system, and recently the concept of brain entropy has been defined as the number of neural states a given brain can access. This study investigates the relationship between human intelligence and brain entropy, to determine whether neural variability as reflected in neuroimaging signals carries information about intellectual ability. We hypothesize that intelligence will be positively associated with entropy in a sample of 892 healthy adults, using resting-state fMRI. Intelligence is measured with the Shipley Vocabulary and WASI Matrix Reasoning tests. Brain entropy was positively associated with intelligence. This relation was most strongly observed in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal lobes, and cerebellum. This relationship between high brain entropy and high intelligence indicates an essential role for entropy in brain functioning. It demonstrates that access to variable neural states predicts complex behavioral performance, and specifically shows that entropy derived from neuroimaging signals at rest carries information about intellectual capacity. Future work in this area may elucidate the links between brain entropy in both resting and active states and various forms of intelligence. This insight has the potential to provide predictive information about adaptive behavior and to delineate the subdivisions and nature of intelligence based on entropic patterns.},

We all differ in how we perceive, think, and act. What drives individual differences in evoked brain activity? Tavor et al. applied computational models to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project. Brain activity in the ``resting'' state when subjects were not performing any explicit task predicted differences in fMRI activation across a range of cognitive paradigms. This suggests that individual differences in many cognitive tasks are a stable trait marker. Resting-state functional connectivity thus already contains the repertoire that is then expressed during task-based fMRI.
Science, this issue p. 216
When asked to perform the same task, different individuals exhibit markedly different patterns of brain activity. This variability is often attributed to volatile factors, such as task strategy or compliance. We propose that individual differences in brain responses are, to a large degree, inherent to the brain and can be predicted from task-independent measurements collected at rest. Using a large set of task conditions, spanning several behavioral domains, we train a simple model that relates task-independent measurements to task activity and evaluate the model by predicting task activation maps for unseen subjects using magnetic resonance imaging. Our model can accurately predict individual differences in brain activity and highlights a coupling between brain connectivity and function that can be captured at the level of individual subjects.
Brain activation when performing activities can largely be understood from its distinctive anatomy and connectivity.

Unfortunately, test-retest reliability can be very low, depending on the measure and its estimation, the EEG-frequency of interest, the length of the signal, and the population under investigation. In addition, artefacts can hamper the continuity of the EEG signal, and in some clinical situations it is impractical to exclude artefacts. We aimed to examine factors that moderate test-retest reliability of measures of interaction. The study involved 40 patients with a range of neurological diseases and memory impairments (age median: 60; range 21-76; 40\% female; 22 mild cognitive impairment, 5 subjective cognitive complaints, 13 temporal lobe epilepsy), and 20 healthy controls (age median: 61.5; range 23-74; 70\% female). We calculated 14 measures of interaction based on the multivariate autoregressive model from two EEG-recordings separated by two weeks. We characterised test-retest reliability by correlating the measures between the two EEG-recordings for variations of data length, data discontinuity, artefact exclusion, model order, and frequency over all combinations of channels and all frequencies, individually for each subject, yielding a correlation coefficient for each participant. Excluding artefacts had strong effects on reliability of some measures, such as classical, real valued coherence (\textasciitilde{}0.1 before, \textasciitilde{}0.9 after artefact exclusion). Full frequency directed transfer function was highly reliable and robust against artefacts. Variation of data length decreased reliability in relation to poor adjustment of model order and signal length. Variation of discontinuity had no effect, but reliabilities were different between model orders, frequency ranges, and patient groups depending on the measure. Pathology did not interact with variation of signal length or discontinuity. Our results emphasise the importance of documenting reliability, which may vary considerably between measures of interaction. We recommend careful selection of measures of interaction in accordance with the properties of the data. When only short data segments are available and when the signal length varies strongly across subjects after exclusion of artefacts, reliability becomes an issue. Finally, measures which show high reliability irrespective of the presence of artefacts could be extremely useful in clinical situations when exclusion of artefacts is impractical.},

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are techniques suited to capture these interactions, because they provide whole head measurements of brain activity in the millisecond range. More than one sensor picks up the activity of an underlying source. This field spread severely limits the utility of connectivity measures computed directly between sensor recordings. Consequentially, neuronal interactions should be studied on the level of the reconstructed sources. This article reviews several methods that have been applied to investigate interactions between brain regions in source space. We will mainly focus on the different measures used to quantify connectivity, and on the different strategies adopted to identify regions of interest. Despite various successful accounts of MEG and EEG source connectivity, caution with respect to the interpretation of the results is still warranted. This is due to the fact that effects of field spread can never be completely abolished in source space. However, in this very exciting and developing field of research this cautionary note should not discourage researchers from further investigation into the connectivity between neuronal sources.

  abstract = {Objective. Graph theory and network science tools have revealed fundamental mechanisms of functional brain organization in resting-state M/EEG analysis. Nevertheless, it is still not clearly understood how several methodological aspects may bias the topology of the reconstructed functional networks. In this context, the literature shows inconsistency in the chosen length of the selected epochs, impeding a meaningful comparison between results from different studies. Approach. The aim of this study was to provide a network approach insensitive to the effects that epoch length has on functional connectivity and network reconstruction. Two different measures, the phase lag index (PLI) and the amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) were applied to EEG resting-state recordings for a group of 18 healthy volunteers using non-overlapping epochs with variable length (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 s). Weighted clustering coefficient (CC w ), weighted characteristic path length ( L w ) and minimum spanning tree (MST) parameters were computed to evaluate the network topology. The analysis was performed on both scalp and source-space data. Main results. Results from scalp analysis show a decrease in both mean PLI and AEC values with an increase in epoch length, with a tendency to stabilize at a length of 12 s for PLI and 6 s for AEC. Moreover, CC w and L w show very similar behaviour, with metrics based on AEC more reliable in terms of stability. In general, MST parameters stabilize at short epoch lengths, particularly for MSTs based on PLI (1\textendash{}6 s versus 4\textendash{}8 s for AEC). At the source-level the results were even more reliable, with stability already at 1 s duration for PLI-based MSTs. Significance. The present work suggests that both PLI and AEC depend on epoch length and that this has an impact on the reconstructed network topology, particularly at the scalp-level. Source-level MST topology is less sensitive to differences in epoch length, therefore enabling the comparison of brain network topology between different studies.},

  abstract = {Functional connectivity analysis has become a powerful tool for probing the human brain function and its breakdown in neuropsychiatry disorders. So far, most studies adopted resting-state paradigm to examine functional connectivity networks in the brain, thanks to its low demand and high tolerance that are essential for clinical studies. However, the test\textendash{}retest reliability of resting-state connectivity measures is moderate, potentially due to its low behavioral constraint. On the other hand, naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms, an emerging approach for cognitive neuroscience with high ecological validity, could potentially improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the test\textendash{}retest reliability of functional connectivity measures during a natural viewing condition, and benchmarked it against resting-state connectivity measures acquired within the same functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. We found that the reliability of connectivity and graph theoretical measures of brain networks is significantly improved during natural viewing conditions over resting-state conditions, with an average increase of almost 50\% across various connectivity measures. Not only sensory networks for audio\textendash{}visual processing become more reliable, higher order brain networks, such as default mode and attention networks, but also appear to show higher reliability during natural viewing. Our results support the use of natural viewing paradigms in estimating functional connectivity of brain networks, and have important implications for clinical application of fMRI.

  abstract = {Objective. Graph theory and network science tools have revealed fundamental mechanisms of functional brain organization in resting-state M/EEG analysis. Nevertheless, it is still not clearly understood how several methodological aspects may bias the topology of the reconstructed functional networks. In this context, the literature shows inconsistency in the chosen length of the selected epochs, impeding a meaningful comparison between results from different studies. Approach. The aim of this study was to provide a network approach insensitive to the effects that epoch length has on functional connectivity and network reconstruction. Two different measures, the phase lag index (PLI) and the amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) were applied to EEG resting-state recordings for a group of 18 healthy volunteers using non-overlapping epochs with variable length (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 s). Weighted clustering coefficient (CC w ), weighted characteristic path length ( L w ) and minimum spanning tree (MST) parameters were computed to evaluate the network topology. The analysis was performed on both scalp and source-space data. Main results. Results from scalp analysis show a decrease in both mean PLI and AEC values with an increase in epoch length, with a tendency to stabilize at a length of 12 s for PLI and 6 s for AEC. Moreover, CC w and L w show very similar behaviour, with metrics based on AEC more reliable in terms of stability. In general, MST parameters stabilize at short epoch lengths, particularly for MSTs based on PLI (1\textendash{}6 s versus 4\textendash{}8 s for AEC). At the source-level the results were even more reliable, with stability already at 1 s duration for PLI-based MSTs. Significance. The present work suggests that both PLI and AEC depend on epoch length and that this has an impact on the reconstructed network topology, particularly at the scalp-level. Source-level MST topology is less sensitive to differences in epoch length, therefore enabling the comparison of brain network topology between different studies.},

Here, we show that reduction in response latencies to solve complex logic problem indexing fluid intelligence is obtained through 40~Hz-tACS (gamma~band) applied to the prefrontal cortex. This improvement in human performance depends on individual ability, with slower performers at baseline receiving greater benefits. The effect could have not being explained by regression to the mean, and showed task and frequency specificity: it was not observed for trials not involving logical reasoning, as well as with the application of low frequency 5~Hz-tACS (theta band) or non-periodic high frequency random noise stimulation (101\textendash{}640~Hz). Moreover, performance in a spatial working memory task was not affected by brain stimulation, excluding possible effects on fluid intelligence enhancement through an increase in memory performance. We suggest that such high-level cognitive functions are dissociable by frequency-specific neuromodulatory effects, possibly related to entrainment of specific brain rhythms. We conclude that individual differences in cognitive abilities, due to acquired or developmental origins, could be reduced during frequency-specific tACS, a finding that should be taken into account for future individual cognitive rehabilitation studies.},

  abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates excitability of motor cortex. However, there is conflicting evidence about the efficacy of this non-invasive brain stimulation modality to modulate performance on cognitive tasks. Previous work has tested the effect of tDCS on specific facets of cognition and executive processing. However, no randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study has looked at the effects of tDCS on a comprehensive battery of cognitive processes. The objective of this study was to test if tDCS had an effect on performance on a comprehensive assay of cognitive processes, a standardized intelligence quotient (IQ) test. The study consisted of two substudies and followed a double-blind, between-subjects, sham-controlled design. In total, 41 healthy adult participants were included in the final analysis. These participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) as a baseline measure. At least one week later, participants in substudy 1 received either bilateral tDCS (anodes over both F4 and F3, cathode over Cz, 2mA at each anode for 20min) or active sham tDCS (2mA for 40s), and participants in substudy 2 received either right or left tDCS (anode over either F4 or F3, cathode over Cz, 2mA for 20min). In both studies, the WAIS-IV was immediately administered following stimulation to assess for performance differences induced by bilateral and unilateral tDCS. Compared to sham stimulation, right, left, and bilateral tDCS reduced improvement between sessions on Full Scale IQ and the Perceptual Reasoning Index. This demonstration that frontal tDCS selectively degraded improvement on specific metrics of the WAIS-IV raises important questions about the often proposed role of tDCS in cognitive enhancement.},

  abstract = {Already in his first report on the discovery of the human EEG in 1929, Berger showed great interest in further elucidating the functional roles of the alpha and beta waves for normal mental activities. Meanwhile, most cognitive processes have been linked to at least one of the traditional frequency bands in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma range. Although the existing wealth of high-quality correlative EEG data led many researchers to the conviction that brain oscillations subserve various sensory and cognitive processes, a causal role can only be demonstrated by directly modulating such oscillatory signals. In this review, we highlight several methods to selectively modulate neuronal oscillations, including EEG-neurofeedback, rhythmic sensory stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In particular, we discuss tACS as the most recent technique to directly modulate oscillatory brain activity. Such studies demonstrating the effectiveness of tACS comprise reports on purely behavioral or purely electrophysiological effects, on combination of behavioral effects with offline EEG measurements or on simultaneous (online) tACS-EEG recordings. Whereas most tACS studies are designed to modulate ongoing rhythmic brain activity at a specific frequency, recent evidence suggests that tACS may also modulate cross-frequency interactions. Taken together, the modulation of neuronal oscillations allows to demonstrate causal links between brain oscillations and cognitive processes and to obtain important insights into human brain function.},

Theta tACS was applied to the left parietal and left frontal brain areas of healthy participants after which resting electroencephalogram (EEG) data was recorded. Following sham/active stimulation, the participants solved two tests of fluid intelligence while their EEG was recorded. The results showed that active theta tACS affected spectral power in theta and alpha frequency bands. In addition, active theta tACS improved performance on tests of fluid intelligence. This influence was more pronounced in the group of participants that received stimulation to the left parietal area than in the group of participants that received stimulation to the left frontal area. Left parietal tACS increased performance on the difficult test items of both tests (RAPM and PF\&C) whereas left frontal tACS increased performance only on the easy test items of one test (RAPM). The observed behavioral tACS influences were also accompanied by changes in neuroelectric activity. The behavioral and neuroelectric data tentatively support the P-FIT neurobiological model of intelligence.},

We found that attention led to increased high-frequency gamma-band activity and decreased lower frequency theta-, alpha-, and beta-band activity in early sensory cortex areas. Moreover, alpha-band coherence decreased in visual cortex. Frontal cortex was found to exert attentional control through increased low-frequency phase synchronisation. Crossmodal congruence modulated beta-band coherence in mid-cingulate and superior temporal cortex. Together, these results offer an integrative view on the concurrence of oscillations at different frequencies during multisensory attention.},

In contrast to a control condition, in which dynamic changes in cortical networks were spread evenly across systems, the effortful working-memory condition was characterized by a reconfiguration of frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks. This reconfiguration, which characterizes ``network flexibility,'' employs transient and heterogeneous connectivity between frontal systems, which we refer to as ``integration.'' Frontal integration predicted neuropsychological measures requiring working memory and executive cognition, suggesting that dynamic network reconfiguration between frontal systems supports those functions. Our results characterize dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale distributed neural circuits during executive cognition in humans and have implications for understanding impaired cognitive function in disorders affecting connectivity, such as schizophrenia or dementia.},

It is clear that two functionally distinct and potentially competing brain networks can be broadly distinguished by their contrasting roles in attention to the external world versus the internally directed mentation or concentration. During concentration, EEG delta (1-3.5 Hz) activity increases mainly in frontal leads in different tasks: mental calculation, semantic tasks, and the Sternberg paradigm. This last task is considered a working memory task, but in neural, as well as phenomenological, terms, working memory can be best understood as attention focused on an internal representation. In the Sternberg task, increases in power in the frequencies from 1 to 3.90 Hz in frontal regions are reported. In a Go/No-Go task, power increases at 1 Hz in both conditions were observed during 100\textendash{}300 ms in central, parietal and temporal regions. However, in the No-Go condition, power increases were also observed in frontal regions, suggesting its participation in the inhibition of the motor response. Increases in delta power were also reported during semantic tasks in children. In conclusion, the results suggest that power increases of delta frequencies during mental tasks are associated with functional cortical deafferentation, or inhibition of the sensory afferences that interfere with internal concentration. These inhibitory oscillations would modulate the activity of those networks that should be inactive to accomplish the task.},

  abstract = {Human intelligence comprises comprehension of and reasoning about an infinitely variable external environment. A brain capable of large variability in neural configurations, or states, will more easily understand and predict variable external events. Entropy measures the variety of configurations possible within a system, and recently the concept of brain entropy has been defined as the number of neural states a given brain can access. This study investigates the relationship between human intelligence and brain entropy, to determine whether neural variability as reflected in neuroimaging signals carries information about intellectual ability. We hypothesize that intelligence will be positively associated with entropy in a sample of 892 healthy adults, using resting-state fMRI. Intelligence is measured with the Shipley Vocabulary and WASI Matrix Reasoning tests. Brain entropy was positively associated with intelligence. This relation was most strongly observed in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal lobes, and cerebellum. This relationship between high brain entropy and high intelligence indicates an essential role for entropy in brain functioning. It demonstrates that access to variable neural states predicts complex behavioral performance, and specifically shows that entropy derived from neuroimaging signals at rest carries information about intellectual capacity. Future work in this area may elucidate the links between brain entropy in both resting and active states and various forms of intelligence. This insight has the potential to provide predictive information about adaptive behavior and to delineate the subdivisions and nature of intelligence based on entropic patterns.},

In contrast, an attractor state, called self-organized critical (SOC), was proposed to govern brain dynamics because it allows for optimal information coding.

We characterized neuronal avalanches \textendash{} spatiotemporal waves of enhanced activity - from dense intracranial depth recordings in humans. We showed that avalanche distributions closely follow a power law \textendash{} the hallmark feature of SOC - for each vigilance state. However, avalanches clearly differ with vigilance states: slow wave sleep (SWS) shows large avalanches, wakefulness intermediate, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep small ones. Our SOC model, together with the data, suggested first that the differences are mediated by global but tiny changes in synaptic strength, and second, that the changes with vigilance states reflect small deviations from criticality to the subcritical regime, implying that the human brain does not operate at criticality proper but close to SOC. Independent of criticality, the analysis confirms that SWS shows increased correlations between cortical areas, and reveals that REM sleep shows more fragmented cortical dynamics.},

Here we study whether a particular type of spontaneous activity is generated by a network that is optimized for input processing. Neuronal avalanches are a type of spontaneous activity observed in superficial cortical layers in vitro and in vivo with statistical properties expected from a network operating at ``criticality.'' Theory predicts that criticality and, therefore, neuronal avalanches are optimal for input processing, but until now, this has not been tested in experiments. Here, we use cortex slice cultures grown on planar microelectrode arrays to demonstrate that cortical networks that generate neuronal avalanches benefit from a maximized dynamic range, i.e., the ability to respond to the greatest range of stimuli. By changing the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus processing as a function of distance from criticality in agreement with predictions from our simulations. Our findings suggest that in the cortex, (1) balanced excitation and inhibition establishes criticality, which maximizes the range of inputs that can be processed, and (2) spontaneous activity and input processing are unified in the context of critical phenomena.},

Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has proven particularly useful, revealing that genetic variation, normal development, or disease can lead to differences in the scale-free amplitude modulation of oscillations. Furthermore, amplitude dynamics is remarkably independent of the time-averaged oscillation power, indicating that the DFA provides unique insights into the functional organization of neuronal systems. To facilitate understanding and encourage wider use of scaling analysis of neuronal oscillations, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the DFA algorithm and its underlying theory. Practical advice on applying DFA to oscillations is supported by MATLAB scripts from the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox (NBT) and links to the NBT tutorial website (http://www.nbtwiki.net/). Finally, we provide a brief overview of insights derived from the application of DFA to ongoing oscillations in health and disease, and discuss the putative relevance of criticality for understanding the mechanism underlying scale-free modulation of oscillations.},

Our results show that when synchronization of neuronal activity occurs over distances of $>$ 2 mm in primary visual cortex, or occurs between the two hemispheres, it is almost always associated with oscillatory firing patterns, whereas synchronization over short distances occurs also in the absence of oscillations. Furthermore, our results indicate that short-range interactions affect both the firing rate of the respective neurons and the timing of their discharges, whereas only the latter is influenced by long-range interactions. These data support the hypothesis that oscillatory activity can contribute to the establishment of long-range synchrony in a network of reciprocally coupled neurons.},

Recent resting-state fMRI studies have suggested that inter-regional functional connectivity shows a small-world topology, indicating an organization of the brain in highly clustered sub-networks, combined with a high level of global connectivity. In addition, a few studies have investigated a possible scale-free topology of the human brain, but the results of these studies have been inconclusive. These studies have mainly focused on inter-regional connectivity, representing the brain as a network of brain regions, requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However, using a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free examination of both inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity and might reveal new information on network organization. Especially, a voxel-based study could give information about a possible scale-free organization of functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3~Tesla fMRI recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and individual connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical and sub-cortical voxels with connections reflecting inter-voxel functional connectivity. Graph characteristics from these connectivity networks were computed. The clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random graphs, together with a short average path length, indicating a small-world organization. Furthermore, the connectivity distribution of the number of inter-voxel connections followed a power-law scaling with an exponent close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. Our findings suggest a combined small-world and scale-free organization of the functionally connected human brain. The results are interpreted as evidence for a highly efficient organization of the functionally connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with their direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which are held together by a small number of highly connected hub-voxels that ensure a high level of overall connectivity.},

  abstract = {I propose that synchronization affects communication between neuronal groups. Gamma-band (30\textendash{}90~Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8\textendash{}20~Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7\textendash{}8~Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.},

  abstract = {The brain is a complex dynamic system of functionally connected regions. Graph theory has been successfully used to describe the organization of such dynamic systems. Recent resting-state fMRI studies have suggested that inter-regional functional connectivity shows a small-world topology, indicating an organization of the brain in highly clustered sub-networks, combined with a high level of global connectivity. In addition, a few studies have investigated a possible scale-free topology of the human brain, but the results of these studies have been inconclusive. These studies have mainly focused on inter-regional connectivity, representing the brain as a network of brain regions, requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However, using a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free examination of both inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity and might reveal new information on network organization. Especially, a voxel-based study could give information about a possible scale-free organization of functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3~Tesla fMRI recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and individual connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical and sub-cortical voxels with connections reflecting inter-voxel functional connectivity. Graph characteristics from these connectivity networks were computed. The clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random graphs, together with a short average path length, indicating a small-world organization. Furthermore, the connectivity distribution of the number of inter-voxel connections followed a power-law scaling with an exponent close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. Our findings suggest a combined small-world and scale-free organization of the functionally connected human brain. The results are interpreted as evidence for a highly efficient organization of the functionally connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with their direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which are held together by a small number of highly connected hub-voxels that ensure a high level of overall connectivity.},

Exceedingly long transients emerge at higher densities p; their activity patterns are disordered, in contrast to the mostly periodic persistent patterns observed at low p.

Individual differences in intelligence are strongly associated with many important life outcomes, including educational and occupational attainments, income, health and lifespan. Data from twin and family studies are consistent with a high heritability of intelligence, but this inference has been controversial. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of 3511 unrelated adults with data on 549 692 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and detailed phenotypes on cognitive traits. We estimate that 40\% of the variation in crystallized-type intelligence and 51\% of the variation in fluid-type intelligence between individuals is accounted for by linkage disequilibrium between genotyped common SNP markers and unknown causal variants. These estimates provide lower bounds for the narrow-sense heritability of the traits. We partitioned genetic variation on individual chromosomes and found that, on average, longer chromosomes explain more variation. Finally, using just SNP data we predicted $\sim$1\% of the variance of crystallized and fluid cognitive phenotypes in an independent sample (P=0.009 and 0.028, respectively). Our results unequivocally confirm that a substantial proportion of individual differences in human intelligence is due to genetic variation, and are consistent with many genes of small effects underlying the additive genetic influences on intelligence.},

  abstract = {Structural connectivity in the brain is the basis of functional connectivity. Quantitatively linking the two, however, remains a challenge. For a pair of regions of interest (ROIs), anatomical connections derived from diffusion-weighted imaging are often quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA) or edge weight, whereas functional connections, derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, can be characterized by non-time-series measures such as zero-lag cross correlation and partial correlation, as well as by time-series measures such as coherence and Granger causality. In this study, we addressed the question of linking structural connectivity and functional connectivity quantitatively by considering two pairs of ROIs, one from the default mode network (DMN) and the other from the central executive network (CEN), using two different data sets. Selecting (1) posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex of the DMN as the first pair of ROIs and (2) left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and left inferior parietal lobule of the CEN as the second pair of ROIs, we show that (1) zero-lag cross correlation, partial correlation, and pairwise Granger causality were not significantly correlated with either mean FA or edge weight and (2) conditional Granger causality (CGC) was significantly correlated with edge weight but not with mean FA. These results suggest that (1) edge weight may be a more appropriate measure to quantify the strength of the anatomical connection between ROIs and (2) CGC, which statistically removes common input and the indirect influences between a given ROI pair, may be a more appropriate measure to quantify the strength of the functional interaction enabled by the fibers linking the two ROIs.},

  abstract = {Speech comprehension is preserved up to a threefold acceleration, but deteriorates rapidly at higher speeds. Current models posit that perceptual resilience to accelerated speech is limited by the brain's ability to parse speech into syllabic units using $\delta$/\texttheta{} oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the involvement of neuronal oscillations in processing accelerated speech also relates to their scale-free amplitude modulation as indexed by the strength of long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). We recorded MEG while 24 human subjects (12 females) listened to radio news uttered at different comprehensible rates, at a mostly unintelligible rate and at this same speed interleaved with silence gaps. $\delta$, \texttheta, and low-$\gamma$ oscillations followed the nonlinear variation of comprehension, with LRTC rising only at the highest speed. In contrast, increasing the rate was associated with a monotonic increase in LRTC in high-$\gamma$ activity. When intelligibility was restored with the insertion of silence gaps, LRTC in the $\delta$, \texttheta, and low-$\gamma$ oscillations resumed the low levels observed for intelligible speech. Remarkably, the lower the individual subject scaling exponents of $\delta$/\texttheta{} oscillations, the greater the comprehension of the fastest speech rate. Moreover, the strength of LRTC of the speech envelope decreased at the maximal rate, suggesting an inverse relationship with the LRTC of brain dynamics when comprehension halts. Our findings show that scale-free amplitude modulation of cortical oscillations and speech signals are tightly coupled to speech uptake capacity.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT One may read this statement in 20\textendash{}30 s, but reading it in less than five leaves us clueless. Our minds limit how much information we grasp in an instant. Understanding the neural constraints on our capacity for sensory uptake is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Here, MEG was used to investigate neuronal activity while subjects listened to radio news played faster and faster until becoming unintelligible. We found that speech comprehension is related to the scale-free dynamics of $\delta$ and \texttheta{} bands, whereas this property in high-$\gamma$ fluctuations mirrors speech rate. We propose that successful speech processing imposes constraints on the self-organization of synchronous cell assemblies and their scale-free dynamics adjusts to the temporal properties of spoken language.},

  abstract = {During performance of attention-demanding cognitive tasks, certain regions of the brain routinely increase activity, whereas others routinely decrease activity. In this study, we investigate the extent to which this task-related dichotomy is represented intrinsically in the resting human brain through examination of spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal. We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function. We suggest that both task-driven neuronal responses and behavior are reflections of this dynamic, ongoing, functional organization of the brain.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the functional connectivity of different EEG bands at the ``baseline'' situation (rest) and during mathematical thinking in children and young adults to study the maturation effect on brain networks at rest and during a cognitive task. Methods: Twenty children (8\textendash{}12 years) and twenty students (21\textendash{}26 years) were studied. The synchronization likelihood was used to evaluate the interregional synchronization of different EEG frequency bands in children and adults, at rest and during math. Then, graphs were constructed and characterized in terms of local structure (clustering coefficient) and overall integration (path length) and the ``optimal'' organization of the connectivity i.e., the small world network (SWN). Results: The main findings were: (i) Enhanced synchronization for theta band during math more prominent in adults. (ii) Decrease of the optimal SWN organization of the alpha2 band during math. (iii) The beta and especially gamma bands showed lower synchronization and signs of lower SWN organization in both situations in adults. Conclusion: There are interesting findings related to the two age groups and the two situations. The theta band showed higher synchronization during math in adults as a result of higher capacity of the working memory in this age group. The alpha2 band showed some SWN disorganization during math, a process analog to the known desynchronization. In adults, a dramatic reduction of the connections in gray matter occurs. Although this maturation process is probably related to higher efficiency, reduced connectivity is expressed by lower synchronization and lower mean values of the graph parameters in adults.

  abstract = {Several non-invasive imaging methods have contributed to shed light on the brain mechanisms underlying working memory (WM). The aim of the present study was to depict the topology of the relevant EEG-derived brain networks associated to distinct operations of WM function elicited by the Sternberg Item Recognition Task (SIRT) such as encoding, storage and retrieval in healthy, middle age (46 $\pm$ 5yrs) adults. High density EEG recordings were performed in 17 participants whilst attending a visual SIRT. Neural correlates of WM were assessed by means of a combination of EEG signal processing methods (ie, time-varying connectivity estimation and graph theory), in order to extract synthetic descriptors of the complex networks underlying the encoding, storage and retrieval phases of WM construct. The group analysis revealed that the encoding phase exhibited a significantly higher small-world topology of EEG networks with respect to storage and retrieval in all EEG frequency band oscillations, thus indicating that during the encoding of items the global network organization could ``optimally'' promote the information flow between WM sub-networks. We also found that the magnitude of such configuration could predict subject behavioral performance when memory load increased as indicated by the negative correlation between Reaction Time and the local efficiency values estimated during the encoding in the alpha band in both 4 and 6 digits conditions. At the local scale, the values of the degree index which measures the degree of in- and out- information flow between scalp areas were found to specifically distinguish the hubs within the relevant sub-networks associated to each of the 3 different WM phases, according to the different role of the sub-network of regions in the different WM phases. Our findings indicate that the use of EEG-derived connectivity measures and their related topological indices might offer a reliable and yet affordable approach to monitor WM components and thus theoretically support the clinical assessment of cognitive functions in presence of WM decline/impairment, as it occurs after stroke.},

  abstract = {The refinement of localization of intelligence in the human brain is converging onto a distributed network that broadly conforms to the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT). While this theory has received support in the neuroimaging literature, no functional magnetic resonance imaging study to date has conducted a whole-brain network-wise examination of the changes during engagement in tasks that are reliable measures of general intelligence (e.g., Raven's Progressive Matrices Test; RPM). Seventy-nine healthy subjects were scanned while solving RPM problems and during rest. Functional networks were extracted from the RPM and resting state data using Independent Component Analysis. Twenty-nine networks were identified, 26 of which were detected in both conditions. Fourteen networks were significantly correlated with the RPM task. The networks' spatial maps and functional connectivity measures at 3 frequency levels (low, medium, \& high) were compared between the RPM and rest conditions. The regions involved in the networks that were found to be task related were consistent with the P-FIT, localizing to the bilateral medial frontal and parietal regions, right superior frontal lobule, and the right cingulate gyrus. Functional connectivity in multiple component pairs was differentially affected across all frequency levels during the RPM task. Our findings demonstrate that functional brain networks are more stable than previously thought, and maintain their general features across resting state and engagement in a complex cognitive task. The described spatial and functional connectivity alterations that such components undergo during fluid reasoning provide a network-wise framework of the P-FIT that can be valuable for further, network based, neuroimaging inquiries regarding the neural underpinnings of intelligence.},

We used additional graph theoretical measures to better characterize the nature of LPFC connectivity and its relationship with fluid intelligence. We specifically hypothesized that LPFC is a connector hub with an across-network connectivity that contributes to fluid intelligence independent of within-network connectivity. We verified that LPFC was in the top 10\% of brain regions in terms of across-network connectivity, suggesting it is a strong connector hub. Importantly, we found that the LPFC across-network connectivity predicted individuals' fluid intelligence and this correlation remained statistically significant when controlling for global connectivity (which includes within-network connectivity). This supports the conclusion that across-network connectivity independently contributes to the relationship between LPFC connectivity and intelligence. These results suggest that LPFC contributes to fluid intelligence by being a connector hub with a truly global multisystem connectivity throughout the brain.},

It has been hypothesized that the brain works to minimize the resources allocated towards higher cognitive functioning. Thus, for the intelligent brain it may be that not simply more is better, but rather more efficient is better. Energy metabolism supports both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission processes. Indeed, in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, the primary energetic costs are associated with neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that minimizing resources through the excitation- inhibition balance encompassing GABA and glutamate may be beneficial to general cognitive functioning using 7T 1H-MRS in 23 healthy individuals (male/female=16/7, 27.7$\pm$5.3 years). We find that a higher working memory index is significantly correlated with a lower GABA to glutamate ratio in the frontal cortex and with a lower glutamate level in the occipital cortex. Thus, it seems that working memory performance is associated with the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain.},

  abstract = {Electrical brain stimulation is currently being investigated as a potential therapy for neurological disease. However, opportunities to optimize and personalize such therapies are challenged by the fact that the beneficial impact (and potential side effects) of focal stimulation on both neighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network control theory to build a formal model of brain network function that makes explicit predictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter network and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data from patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergoing evaluation for resective surgery, and who volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a specific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation, defining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states associated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model, we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical stimulation than the artificial patterns of a topological or spatial network null model. We then use a targeted optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on energy requirements. We show that the strength and homogeneity of edges between controlled and uncontrolled nodes, as well as the persistent modal controllability of the stimulated region, predict energy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter architecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical stimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of network control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.},

However, a precise characterization of these reconfiguration processes during cognitive function in humans remains elusive. Here, we use a series of techniques developed in the field of ``dynamic network neuroscience'' to investigate the dynamics of functional brain networks in 344 healthy subjects during a working-memory challenge (the ``n-back'' task). In contrast to a control condition, in which dynamic changes in cortical networks were spread evenly across systems, the effortful working-memory condition was characterized by a reconfiguration of frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks. This reconfiguration, which characterizes ``network flexibility,'' employs transient and heterogeneous connectivity between frontal systems, which we refer to as ``integration.'' Frontal integration predicted neuropsychological measures requiring working memory and executive cognition, suggesting that dynamic network reconfiguration between frontal systems supports those functions. Our results characterize dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale distributed neural circuits during executive cognition in humans and have implications for understanding impaired cognitive function in disorders affecting connectivity, such as schizophrenia or dementia.},

These spatiotemporal patterns, called resting state networks, display low-frequency characteristics ($<$0.1 Hz) observed typically in the BOLD-fMRI signal of human subjects. We aim here to understand the origins of resting state activity through modeling via a global spiking attractor network of the brain. This approach offers a realistic mechanistic model at the level of each single brain area based on spiking neurons and realistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. Integrating the biologically realistic diffusion tensor imaging/diffusion spectrum imaging-based neuroanatomical connectivity into the brain model, the resultant emerging resting state functional connectivity of the brain network fits quantitatively best the experimentally observed functional connectivity in humans when the brain network operates at the edge of instability. Under these conditions, the slow fluctuating ($<$0.1 Hz) resting state networks emerge as structured noise fluctuations around a stable low firing activity equilibrium state in the presence of latent ``ghost'' multistable attractors. The multistable attractor landscape defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity.},

  abstract = {Neuronal activity differs between wakefulness and sleep states. In contrast, an attractor state, called self-organized critical (SOC), was proposed to govern brain dynamics because it allows for optimal information coding. But is the human brain SOC for each vigilance state despite the variations in neuronal dynamics? We characterized neuronal avalanches \textendash{} spatiotemporal waves of enhanced activity - from dense intracranial depth recordings in humans. We showed that avalanche distributions closely follow a power law \textendash{} the hallmark feature of SOC - for each vigilance state. However, avalanches clearly differ with vigilance states: slow wave sleep (SWS) shows large avalanches, wakefulness intermediate, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep small ones. Our SOC model, together with the data, suggested first that the differences are mediated by global but tiny changes in synaptic strength, and second, that the changes with vigilance states reflect small deviations from criticality to the subcritical regime, implying that the human brain does not operate at criticality proper but close to SOC. Independent of criticality, the analysis confirms that SWS shows increased correlations between cortical areas, and reveals that REM sleep shows more fragmented cortical dynamics.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous neuronal activity is a ubiquitous feature of cortex. Its spatiotemporal organization reflects past input and modulates future network output. Here we study whether a particular type of spontaneous activity is generated by a network that is optimized for input processing. Neuronal avalanches are a type of spontaneous activity observed in superficial cortical layers in vitro and in vivo with statistical properties expected from a network operating at ``criticality.'' Theory predicts that criticality and, therefore, neuronal avalanches are optimal for input processing, but until now, this has not been tested in experiments. Here, we use cortex slice cultures grown on planar microelectrode arrays to demonstrate that cortical networks that generate neuronal avalanches benefit from a maximized dynamic range, i.e., the ability to respond to the greatest range of stimuli. By changing the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus processing as a function of distance from criticality in agreement with predictions from our simulations. Our findings suggest that in the cortex, (1) balanced excitation and inhibition establishes criticality, which maximizes the range of inputs that can be processed, and (2) spontaneous activity and input processing are unified in the context of critical phenomena.},

  abstract = {Scale-free fluctuations are ubiquitous in behavioral performance and neuronal activity. In time scales from seconds to hundreds of seconds, psychophysical dynamics and the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal oscillations are governed by power-law-form long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). In millisecond time scales, neuronal activity comprises cascade-like neuronal avalanches that exhibit power-law size and lifetime distributions. However, it remains unknown whether these neuronal scaling laws are correlated with those characterizing behavioral performance or whether neuronal LRTCs and avalanches are related. Here, we show that the neuronal scaling laws are strongly correlated both with each other and with behavioral scaling laws. We used source reconstructed magneto- and electroencephalographic recordings to characterize the dynamics of ongoing cortical activity. We found robust power-law scaling in neuronal LRTCs and avalanches in resting-state data and during the performance of audiovisual threshold stimulus detection tasks. The LRTC scaling exponents of the behavioral performance fluctuations were correlated with those of concurrent neuronal avalanches and LRTCs in anatomically identified brain systems. The behavioral exponents also were correlated with neuronal scaling laws derived from a resting-state condition and with a similar anatomical topography. Finally, despite the difference in time scales, the scaling exponents of neuronal LRTCs and avalanches were strongly correlated during both rest and task performance. Thus, long and short time-scale neuronal dynamics are related and functionally significant at the behavioral level. These data suggest that the temporal structures of human cognitive fluctuations and behavioral variability stem from the scaling laws of individual and intrinsic brain dynamics.},

In biological systems, scaling laws can reflect adaptive processes of various types and are often linked to complex systems poised near critical points. The same is true for perception, memory, language and other cognitive phenomena.

  abstract = {Brains are composed of networks of an enormous number of neurons interconnected with synapses. Neural information is carried by the electrical signals within neurons and the chemical signals among neurons. Generating these electrical and chemical signals is metabolically expensive. The fundamental issue raised here is whether brains have evolved efficient ways of developing an energy-efficient neural code from the molecular level to the circuit level. Here, we summarize the factors and biophysical mechanisms that could contribute to the energy-efficient neural code for processing input signals. The factors range from ion channel kinetics, body temperature, axonal propagation of action potentials, low-probability release of synaptic neurotransmitters, optimal input and noise, the size of neurons and neuronal clusters, excitation/inhibition balance, coding strategy, cortical wiring, and the organization of functional connectivity. Both experimental and computational evidence suggests that neural systems may use these factors to maximize the efficiency of energy consumption in processing neural signals. Studies indicate that efficient energy utilization may be universal in neuronal systems as an evolutionary consequence of the pressure of limited energy. As a result, neuronal connections may be wired in a highly economical manner to lower energy costs and space. Individual neurons within a network may encode independent stimulus components to allow a minimal number of neurons to represent whole stimulus characteristics efficiently. This basic principle may fundamentally change our view of how billions of neurons organize themselves into complex circuits to operate and generate the most powerful intelligent cognition in nature. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the trial sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the reader to simulate each of these potential problems.

We found that some regions acted as pivotal hubs, either being influenced by or influencing other regions, and thus could be considered as information convergence regions. In addition, we observed that an exponentially truncated power law fits the topological distribution for the degree of total incoming and outgoing connectivity. Furthermore, we also found that this directed network has a modular structure. More importantly, according to our data, we suggest that the human brain directed influence network could have a prominent small-world topological property.},

Examples include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, solar flares, gamma-ray bursts, and biological evolution. Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge have coined the term ``punctuated equilibria'' for this behavior. We argue that punctuated equilibria reflects the tendency of dynamical systems to evolve towards a critical state, and review recent work on simple models. A good metaphoric picture is one where the systems are temporarily trapped in valleys of deformable, interacting landscapes. Similarities with spin glasses are pointed out. Punctuated equilibria are essential for the emergence of complex phenomena. The periods of stasis allow the system to remember its past history; yet the intermittent events permit further change.},

  abstract = {The presence of self-organized criticality in biology is often evidenced by a power-law scaling of event size distributions, which can be measured by linear regression on logarithmic axes. We show here that such a procedure does not necessarily mean that the system exhibits self-organized criticality. We first provide an analysis of multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings of brain activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative LFP peaks can be close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not robust to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous statistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov\textendash{}Smirnov test. Similar power-law scaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that power-law scaling may be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes. We next investigate this problem analytically, and show that, indeed, stochastic processes can produce spurious power-law scaling without the presence of underlying self-organized criticality. However, this power-law is only apparent in logarithmic representations, and does not survive more rigorous analysis such as the Kolmogorov\textendash{}Smirnov test. The same analysis was also performed on an artificial network known to display self-organized criticality. In this case, both the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal with no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law. We conclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious power-law scaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon. This apparent power-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized criticality, which should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests.},

However, bursts are reliably signaled because transmitter release is facilitated. Thus, these synapses can be viewed as filters that transmit bursts, but filter out single spikes. Bursts appear to have a special role in synaptic plasticity and information processing. In the hippocampus, a single burst can produce long-term synaptic modifications. In brain structures whose computational role is known, action potentials that arrive in bursts provide more-precise information than action potentials that arrive singly.

  abstract = {What constitutes normal cortical dynamics in healthy human subjects is a major question in systems neuroscience. Numerous in vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that ongoing or resting cortical dynamics are characterized by cascades of activity across many spatial scales, termed neuronal avalanches. In experiment and theory, avalanche dynamics are identified by two measures: (1) a power law in the size distribution of activity cascades with an exponent of -3/2 and (2) a branching parameter of the critical value of 1, reflecting balanced propagation of activity at the border of premature termination and potential blowup. Here we analyzed resting-state brain activity recorded using noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 124 healthy human subjects and two different MEG facilities using different sensor technologies. We identified large deflections at single MEG sensors and combined them into spatiotemporal cascades on the sensor array using multiple timescales. Cascade size distributions obeyed power laws. For the timescale at which the branching parameter was close to 1, the power law exponent was -3/2. This relationship was robust to scaling and coarse graining of the sensor array. It was absent in phase-shuffled controls with the same power spectrum or empty scanner data. Our results demonstrate that normal cortical activity in healthy human subjects at rest organizes as neuronal avalanches and is well described by a critical branching process. Theory and experiment have shown that such critical, scale-free dynamics optimize information processing. Therefore, our findings imply that the human brain attains an optimal dynamical regime for information processing.},

The fact that people think or behave differently from one another is rooted in individual differences in brain anatomy and connectivity. Here, we used repeated-measurement resting-state functional MRI to explore intersubject variability in connectivity. Individual differences in functional connectivity were heterogeneous across the cortex, with significantly higher variability in heteromodal association cortex and lower variability in unimodal cortices. Intersubject variability in connectivity was significantly correlated with the degree of evolutionary cortical expansion, suggesting a potential evolutionary root of functional variability. The connectivity variability was also related to variability in sulcal depth but not cortical thickness, positively correlated with the degree of long-range connectivity but negatively correlated with local connectivity. A meta-analysis further revealed that regions predicting individual differences in cognitive domains are predominantly located in regions of high connectivity variability. Our findings have potential implications for understanding brain evolution and development, guiding intervention, and interpreting statistical maps in neuroimaging.},

Are neuronal oscillations an inevitable by-product, similar to bridge vibrations, or an essential part of the brain's design? Mammalian cortical neurons form behavior-dependent oscillating networks of various sizes, which span five orders of magnitude in frequency. These oscillations are phylogenetically preserved, suggesting that they are functionally relevant. Recent findings indicate that network oscillations bias input selection, temporally link neurons into assemblies, and facilitate synaptic plasticity, mechanisms that cooperatively support temporal representation and long-term consolidation of information.},

  abstract = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

Here, we review recent experiments on networks of cortical neurons, showing that they appear to be operating near the critical point. Simulation studies capture the main features of these data and suggest that criticality may allow cortical networks to optimize information processing. These simulations lead to predictions that could be tested in the near future, possibly providing further experimental evidence for the criticality hypothesis.},

Long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) are described by power law scaling of the autocorrelation function and have been observed in scalp and intracranial EEG recordings. Synchronous large-amplitude bursts (also called neuronal avalanches) have been observed in local field potentials both in vitro and in vivo. This article explores the presence of neuronal avalanches in scalp and intracranial EEG in the context of LRTC. Results indicate that both scalp and intracranial EEG show LRTC, with larger scaling exponents in scalp recordings than intracranial. A subset of analyzed recordings also show avalanche behavior, indicating that avalanches may be associated with LRTC. Artificial test signals reveal a linear relationship between the scaling exponent measured by detrended fluctuation analysis and the exponent of the avalanche size distribution. Analysis and evaluation of simulated data reveal that preprocessing of EEG (squaring the signal or applying a filter) affect the ability of detrended fluctuation analysis to reliably measure LRTC.},

In the present study long-range temporal correlations in electroencephalographic (EEG) neuronal oscillations were characterized with respect to their topography, frequency-band specificity ($\alpha$ and $\beta$ oscillations), gender and age. EEG was recorded in 91 normal subjects (age 20\textendash{}65 years) in a resting condition. The amplitude of ongoing $\alpha$ and $\beta$ oscillations was extracted with band-pass filtering and Hilbert transform, and long-range temporal correlations were analyzed with detrended fluctuation analysis. The topography of long-range temporal correlations was comparable for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ oscillations, showing largest scaling exponents in the occipital and parietal areas. This topography was partially similar to that of the power distribution and a weak positive correlation was observed between long-range temporal correlations and power of neuronal oscillations. Long-range temporal correlations were stronger in $\alpha$ than $\beta$ oscillations, but only in a few electrode locations in the left hemisphere. In both frequency bands long-range temporal correlations were stronger in males than in females and were largely unaffected by the age of the subjects. It is hypothesized that the idling state of the occipital areas in the closed-eyes condition may explain both large power values and pronounced long-range temporal correlations in this region.},

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.64.011114},
  abstract = {Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis method used to estimate long-range power-law correlation exponents in noisy signals. Many noisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically study the effects of three types of trends \textemdash{} linear, periodic, and power-law trends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data. We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find that crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise and the ``apparent'' scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of these crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend; (ii) the amplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of the power-law trend, and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties of the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy signals with trends also follow scaling laws\textemdash{}i.e., long-range power-law dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We show that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the superposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend, assuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superposed trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in the correlation properties of the noise. In addition, we show how to use DFA appropriately to minimize the effects of trends, how to recognize if a crossover indicates indeed a transition from one type to a different type of underlying correlation, or if the crossover is due to a trend without any transition in the dynamical properties of the noise.},

In this work, we specifically investigated the interplay between network topology and spontaneous dynamics within the framework of self-organized criticality (SOC). The obtained results support the hypothesis that the emergence of critical states occurs in specific complex network topologies. By combining multi-electrode recordings of spontaneous activity of in vitro cortical assemblies with theoretical models, we demonstrate that different `connectivity rules' drive the network towards different dynamic states. In particular, scale-free architectures with different degree of small-worldness account better for the variability observed in experimental data, giving rise to different dynamic states. Moreover, in relationship with the balance between excitation and inhibition and percentage of inhibitory hubs, the simulated cortical networks fall in a critical regime.},

Further, we examine higher order behavior of the steady state system, which predicts that networks with more homogeneous degree distributions should have higher dynamic range.

  abstract = {Neuronal avalanches, measured in vitro and in vivo, exhibit a robust critical behavior. Their temporal organization hides the presence of correlations. Here we present experimental measurements of the waiting time distribution between successive avalanches in the rat cortex in vitro. This exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior not usually found in other natural processes. Numerical simulations provide evidence that this behavior is a consequence of the alternation between states of high and low activity, named up and down states, leading to a balance between excitation and inhibition controlled by a single parameter. During these periods, both the single neuron state and the network excitability level, keeping memory of past activity, are tuned by homeostatic mechanisms.},

In particular, we investigate the impact of different information transmission delays and rewiring probability. We show that short delays induce zigzag fronts of excitations, whereas intermediate delays can further detriment synchrony in the network due to a dynamic clustering anti-phase synchronization transition. Detailed investigations reveal, however, that for longer delay lengths the synchrony of excitations in the network can again be enhanced due to the emergence of in-phase synchronization. In addition, we show that an appropriate small-world topology can restore synchronized behavior provided information transmission delays are either short or long. On the other hand, within the intermediate delay region, which is characterized by anti-phase synchronization and clustering, differences in the network topology do not notably affect the synchrony of neuronal activity.},

This article explores the presence of neuronal avalanches in scalp and intracranial EEG in the context of LRTC. Results indicate that both scalp and intracranial EEG show LRTC, with larger scaling exponents in scalp recordings than intracranial. A subset of analyzed recordings also show avalanche behavior, indicating that avalanches may be associated with LRTC. Artificial test signals reveal a linear relationship between the scaling exponent measured by detrended fluctuation analysis and the exponent of the avalanche size distribution. Analysis and evaluation of simulated data reveal that preprocessing of EEG (squaring the signal or applying a filter) affect the ability of detrended fluctuation analysis to reliably measure LRTC.},

The fact that people think or behave differently from one another is rooted in individual differences in brain anatomy and connectivity. Here, we used repeated-measurement resting-state functional MRI to explore intersubject variability in connectivity. Individual differences in functional connectivity were heterogeneous across the cortex, with significantly higher variability in heteromodal association cortex and lower variability in unimodal cortices. Intersubject variability in connectivity was significantly correlated with the degree of evolutionary cortical expansion, suggesting a potential evolutionary root of functional variability. The connectivity variability was also related to variability in sulcal depth but not cortical thickness, positively correlated with the degree of long-range connectivity but negatively correlated with local connectivity. A meta-analysis further revealed that regions predicting individual differences in cognitive domains are predominantly located in regions of high connectivity variability. Our findings have potential implications for understanding brain evolution and development, guiding intervention, and interpreting statistical maps in neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the functional connectivity of different EEG bands at the ``baseline'' situation (rest) and during mathematical thinking in children and young adults to study the maturation effect on brain networks at rest and during a cognitive task. Methods: Twenty children (8\textendash{}12 years) and twenty students (21\textendash{}26 years) were studied. The synchronization likelihood was used to evaluate the interregional synchronization of different EEG frequency bands in children and adults, at rest and during math. Then, graphs were constructed and characterized in terms of local structure (clustering coefficient) and overall integration (path length) and the ``optimal'' organization of the connectivity i.e., the small world network (SWN). Results: The main findings were: (i) Enhanced synchronization for theta band during math more prominent in adults. (ii) Decrease of the optimal SWN organization of the alpha2 band during math. (iii) The beta and especially gamma bands showed lower synchronization and signs of lower SWN organization in both situations in adults. Conclusion: There are interesting findings related to the two age groups and the two situations. The theta band showed higher synchronization during math in adults as a result of higher capacity of the working memory in this age group. The alpha2 band showed some SWN disorganization during math, a process analog to the known desynchronization. In adults, a dramatic reduction of the connections in gray matter occurs. Although this maturation process is probably related to higher efficiency, reduced connectivity is expressed by lower synchronization and lower mean values of the graph parameters in adults.

  abstract = {The `communication through coherence' (CTC) hypothesis proposes that selective communication among neural networks is achieved by coherence between firing rate oscillation in a sending region and gain modulation in a receiving region. Although this hypothesis has stimulated extensive work, it remains unclear whether the mechanism can in principle allow reliable and selective information transfer. Here we use a simple mathematical model to investigate how accurately coherent gain modulation can filter a population-coded target signal from task-irrelevant distracting inputs. We show that selective communication can indeed be achieved, although the structure of oscillatory activity in the target and distracting networks must satisfy certain previously unrecognized constraints. Firstly, the target input must be differentiated from distractors by the amplitude, phase or frequency of its oscillatory modulation. When distracting inputs oscillate incoherently in the same frequency band as the target, communication accuracy is severely degraded because of varying overlap between the firing rate oscillations of distracting inputs and the gain modulation in the receiving region. Secondly, the oscillatory modulation of the target input must be strong in order to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio relative to stochastic spiking of individual neurons. Thus, whilst providing a quantitative demonstration of the power of coherent oscillatory gain modulation to flexibly control information flow, our results identify constraints imposed by the need to avoid interference between signals, and reveal a likely organizing principle for the structure of neural oscillations in the brain.},

  abstract = {Brains are composed of networks of an enormous number of neurons interconnected with synapses. Neural information is carried by the electrical signals within neurons and the chemical signals among neurons. Generating these electrical and chemical signals is metabolically expensive. The fundamental issue raised here is whether brains have evolved efficient ways of developing an energy-efficient neural code from the molecular level to the circuit level. Here, we summarize the factors and biophysical mechanisms that could contribute to the energy-efficient neural code for processing input signals. The factors range from ion channel kinetics, body temperature, axonal propagation of action potentials, low-probability release of synaptic neurotransmitters, optimal input and noise, the size of neurons and neuronal clusters, excitation/inhibition balance, coding strategy, cortical wiring, and the organization of functional connectivity. Both experimental and computational evidence suggests that neural systems may use these factors to maximize the efficiency of energy consumption in processing neural signals. Studies indicate that efficient energy utilization may be universal in neuronal systems as an evolutionary consequence of the pressure of limited energy. As a result, neuronal connections may be wired in a highly economical manner to lower energy costs and space. Individual neurons within a network may encode independent stimulus components to allow a minimal number of neurons to represent whole stimulus characteristics efficiently. This basic principle may fundamentally change our view of how billions of neurons organize themselves into complex circuits to operate and generate the most powerful intelligent cognition in nature. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Scale-free fluctuations are ubiquitous in behavioral performance and neuronal activity. In time scales from seconds to hundreds of seconds, psychophysical dynamics and the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal oscillations are governed by power-law-form long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). In millisecond time scales, neuronal activity comprises cascade-like neuronal avalanches that exhibit power-law size and lifetime distributions. However, it remains unknown whether these neuronal scaling laws are correlated with those characterizing behavioral performance or whether neuronal LRTCs and avalanches are related. Here, we show that the neuronal scaling laws are strongly correlated both with each other and with behavioral scaling laws. We used source reconstructed magneto- and electroencephalographic recordings to characterize the dynamics of ongoing cortical activity. We found robust power-law scaling in neuronal LRTCs and avalanches in resting-state data and during the performance of audiovisual threshold stimulus detection tasks. The LRTC scaling exponents of the behavioral performance fluctuations were correlated with those of concurrent neuronal avalanches and LRTCs in anatomically identified brain systems. The behavioral exponents also were correlated with neuronal scaling laws derived from a resting-state condition and with a similar anatomical topography. Finally, despite the difference in time scales, the scaling exponents of neuronal LRTCs and avalanches were strongly correlated during both rest and task performance. Thus, long and short time-scale neuronal dynamics are related and functionally significant at the behavioral level. These data suggest that the temporal structures of human cognitive fluctuations and behavioral variability stem from the scaling laws of individual and intrinsic brain dynamics.},

Here we study whether a particular type of spontaneous activity is generated by a network that is optimized for input processing. Neuronal avalanches are a type of spontaneous activity observed in superficial cortical layers in vitro and in vivo with statistical properties expected from a network operating at ``criticality.'' Theory predicts that criticality and, therefore, neuronal avalanches are optimal for input processing, but until now, this has not been tested in experiments. Here, we use cortex slice cultures grown on planar microelectrode arrays to demonstrate that cortical networks that generate neuronal avalanches benefit from a maximized dynamic range, i.e., the ability to respond to the greatest range of stimuli. By changing the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus processing as a function of distance from criticality in agreement with predictions from our simulations. Our findings suggest that in the cortex, (1) balanced excitation and inhibition establishes criticality, which maximizes the range of inputs that can be processed, and (2) spontaneous activity and input processing are unified in the context of critical phenomena.},

These spatiotemporal patterns, called resting state networks, display low-frequency characteristics ($<$0.1 Hz) observed typically in the BOLD-fMRI signal of human subjects. We aim here to understand the origins of resting state activity through modeling via a global spiking attractor network of the brain. This approach offers a realistic mechanistic model at the level of each single brain area based on spiking neurons and realistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. Integrating the biologically realistic diffusion tensor imaging/diffusion spectrum imaging-based neuroanatomical connectivity into the brain model, the resultant emerging resting state functional connectivity of the brain network fits quantitatively best the experimentally observed functional connectivity in humans when the brain network operates at the edge of instability. Under these conditions, the slow fluctuating ($<$0.1 Hz) resting state networks emerge as structured noise fluctuations around a stable low firing activity equilibrium state in the presence of latent ``ghost'' multistable attractors. The multistable attractor landscape defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity.},

  abstract = {Human intelligence comprises comprehension of and reasoning about an infinitely variable external environment. A brain capable of large variability in neural configurations, or states, will more easily understand and predict variable external events. Entropy measures the variety of configurations possible within a system, and recently the concept of brain entropy has been defined as the number of neural states a given brain can access. This study investigates the relationship between human intelligence and brain entropy, to determine whether neural variability as reflected in neuroimaging signals carries information about intellectual ability. We hypothesize that intelligence will be positively associated with entropy in a sample of 892 healthy adults, using resting-state fMRI. Intelligence is measured with the Shipley Vocabulary and WASI Matrix Reasoning tests. Brain entropy was positively associated with intelligence. This relation was most strongly observed in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal lobes, and cerebellum. This relationship between high brain entropy and high intelligence indicates an essential role for entropy in brain functioning. It demonstrates that access to variable neural states predicts complex behavioral performance, and specifically shows that entropy derived from neuroimaging signals at rest carries information about intellectual capacity. Future work in this area may elucidate the links between brain entropy in both resting and active states and various forms of intelligence. This insight has the potential to provide predictive information about adaptive behavior and to delineate the subdivisions and nature of intelligence based on entropic patterns.},

  abstract = {Intelligence is a measure of general cognitive functioning capturing a wide variety of different cognitive functions. It has been hypothesized that the brain works to minimize the resources allocated towards higher cognitive functioning. Thus, for the intelligent brain it may be that not simply more is better, but rather more efficient is better. Energy metabolism supports both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission processes. Indeed, in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, the primary energetic costs are associated with neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that minimizing resources through the excitation- inhibition balance encompassing GABA and glutamate may be beneficial to general cognitive functioning using 7T 1H-MRS in 23 healthy individuals (male/female=16/7, 27.7$\pm$5.3 years). We find that a higher working memory index is significantly correlated with a lower GABA to glutamate ratio in the frontal cortex and with a lower glutamate level in the occipital cortex. Thus, it seems that working memory performance is associated with the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain.},

  abstract = {Several methods have been applied to EEG or MEG signals to detect functional networks. In recent works using MEG/EEG and fMRI data, temporal ICA analysis has been used to extract spatial maps of resting-state networks with or without an atlas-based parcellation of the cortex. Since the links between the fMRI signal and the electromagnetic signals are not fully established, and to avoid any bias, we examined whether EEG alone was able to derive the spatial distribution and temporal characteristics of functional networks. To do so, we propose a two-step original method: 1) An individual multi-frequency data analysis including EEG-based source localisation and spatial independent component analysis, which allowed us to characterize the resting-state networks. 2) A group-level analysis involving a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify reproducible large-scale networks across the population. Compared with large-scale resting-state networks obtained with fMRI, the proposed EEG-based analysis revealed smaller independent networks thanks to the high temporal resolution of EEG, hence hierarchical organization of networks. The comparison showed a substantial overlap between EEG and fMRI networks in motor, premotor, sensory, frontal, and parietal areas. However, there were mismatches between EEG-based and fMRI-based networks in temporal areas, presumably resulting from a poor sensitivity of fMRI in these regions or artefacts in the EEG signals. The proposed method opens the way for studying the high temporal dynamics of networks at the source level thanks to the high temporal resolution of EEG. It would then become possible to study detailed measures of the dynamics of connectivity.},

  abstract = {Electrical brain stimulation is currently being investigated as a potential therapy for neurological disease. However, opportunities to optimize and personalize such therapies are challenged by the fact that the beneficial impact (and potential side effects) of focal stimulation on both neighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network control theory to build a formal model of brain network function that makes explicit predictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter network and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data from patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergoing evaluation for resective surgery, and who volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a specific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation, defining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states associated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model, we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical stimulation than the artificial patterns of a topological or spatial network null model. We then use a targeted optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on energy requirements. We show that the strength and homogeneity of edges between controlled and uncontrolled nodes, as well as the persistent modal controllability of the stimulated region, predict energy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter architecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical stimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of network control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.},

Recent findings challenge the longstanding dogma of $\alpha$-band oscillations as the signature of a passively idling brain state but diverge in terms of interpretation. Despite firm correlations with behavior, the mechanistic role of the $\alpha$-rhythm in brain function remains debated. We suggest that three large-scale brain networks involved in different facets of top-down cognitive control differentially modulate $\alpha$-oscillations, ranging from power within and synchrony between brain regions. Thereby, these networks selectively influence local signal processing, widespread information exchange, and ultimately perception and behavior.},
